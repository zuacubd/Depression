13	WALLACE	Let's get right to it.	/art and entertainment/music/recording industry/music awards;/art and entertainment/shows and events/concert;/law, govt and politics;/art and entertainment/music/singing;/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/art and entertainment/dance;/art and entertainment/celebrity fan and gossip;/society;/society/sex

15	WALLACE	You both talked briefly about the court in the last debate, but I want to drill down on this, because the next president will almost certainly have at least one appointment and likely or possibly two or three appointments.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary;/law, govt and politics/government/parliament;/law, govt and politics/government/executive branch;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections
16	WALLACE	Which means that you will, in effect, determine the balance of the court for what could be the next quarter century.	/law, govt and politics/government;/health and fitness/exercise;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary;/sports/cricket;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/finance/financial news;/law, govt and politics/government/legislative;/society/work;/society/work/unemployment;/family and parenting/children

18	WALLACE	And secondly, what's your view on how the Constitution should be interpreted?	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/parliament;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary
19	WALLACE	Do the founders' words mean what they say or is it a living document to be applied flexibly according to changing circumstances?	/family and parenting/children;/education/english as a second language;/society/crime/property crime;/law, govt and politics;/education/homework and study tips;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/society/senior living;/health and fitness/exercise;/society/social institution/divorce;/business and industrial/business software
20	WALLACE	In this segment, Secretary Clinton, you go first.	/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections
21	WALLACE	You have two minutes.	/sports/curling;/sports/handball;/sports/auto racing;/sports/football;/sports/boat racing;/travel/transports
22	CLINTON	Thank you very much, Chris.	/business and industrial/company/bankruptcy;/business and industrial/green solutions;/sports/olympics;/hobbies and interests/home recording;/business and industrial/company/earnings
23	CLINTON	And thanks to UNLV for hosting us.	/sports/basketball;/business and industrial;/art and entertainment/shows and events/sports event;/business and industrial/business operations;/travel/business travel;/sports/olympics;/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/art and entertainment/shows and events/conference;/business and industrial/business news;/sports/hunting and shooting
24	CLINTON	You know, I think when we talk about the Supreme Court, it really raises the central issue in this election, namely, what kind of country are we going to be?	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary;/law, govt and politics/politics/political parties;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections
25	CLINTON	What kind of opportunities will we provide for our citizens?	/law, govt and politics;/education/studying business;/education/teaching and classroom resources;/law, govt and politics/politics;/education/homework and study tips;/law, govt and politics/immigration;/technology and computing/internet technology;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/family and parenting/children;/careers/career planning
26	CLINTON	What kind of rights will Americans have?	/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/immigration;/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/politics;/society/work;/society/gay life;/family and parenting;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/law, govt and politics/politics/foreign policy
27	CLINTON	And I feel strongly that the Supreme Court needs to stand on the side of the American people, not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy.	/law, govt and politics/government;/business and industrial/company;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary;/business and industrial/company/earnings;/society/work;/law, govt and politics/politics;/finance/financial news;/law, govt and politics/government/executive branch
28	CLINTON	For me, that means that we need a Supreme Court that will stand up on behalf of women's rights, on behalf of the rights of the LGBT community, that will stand up and say no to Citizens United, a decision that has undermined the election system in our country because of the way it permits dark, unaccountable money to come into our electoral system.	/law, govt and politics;/health and fitness/women's health;/society/gay life;/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/politics/political parties;/law, govt and politics/government/parliament;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement
29	CLINTON	I have major disagreements with my opponent about these issues and others that will be before the Supreme Court.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary;/law, govt and politics/government/executive branch
30	CLINTON	But I feel that at this point in our country's history, it is important that we not reverse marriage equality, that we not reverse Roe v. Wade, that we stand up against Citizens United, we stand up for the rights of people in the workplace, that we stand up and basically say: The Supreme Court should represent all of us.	/law, govt and politics/government;/society/sex/sex education;/society/gay life;/health and fitness/incest and abuse support;/health and fitness/women's health;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary;/society/social institution/marriage/common law marriage;/society/work;/law, govt and politics/government/legislative
31	CLINTON	That's how I see the court, and the kind of people that I would be looking to nominate to the court would be in the great tradition of standing up to the powerful, standing up on behalf of our rights as Americans.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary;/society/unrest and war;/family and parenting/children
32	CLINTON	And I look forward to having that opportunity.	/education/teaching and classroom resources;/education/studying business;/finance/grants, scholarships and financial aid;/careers/career planning;/education/homework and study tips;/education/teaching and classroom resources/school supplies;/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/business and industrial/business operations/management/business process;/education/school;/careers/job fairs
33	CLINTON	I would hope that the Senate would do its job and confirm the nominee that President Obama has sent to them.	/law, govt and politics/government
34	CLINTON	That's the way the Constitution fundamentally should operate.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/parliament;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary
35	CLINTON	The president nominates, and then the Senate advises and consents, or not, but they go forward with the process.	/law, govt and politics/government
36	WALLACE	Secretary Clinton, thank you.	/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections
37	WALLACE	Mr. Trump, same question.	/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections
38	WALLACE	Where do you want to see the court take the country?	/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/society/unrest and war;/society/crime/personal offense
39	WALLACE	And how do you believe the Constitution should be interpreted?	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/parliament;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary
40	TRUMP	Well, first of all, it's great to be with you, and thank you, everybody.	/society/unrest and war;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/style and fashion;/society/senior living;/law, govt and politics/politics;/sports/go kart;/society/dating;/style and fashion/body art;/family and parenting/children
41	TRUMP	The Supreme Court: It's what it's all about.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary;/law, govt and politics/legal issues/legislation/family laws;/law, govt and politics/legal issues/civil rights/privacy
42	TRUMP	Our country is so, so -- it's just so imperative that we have the right justices.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement
43	TRUMP	Something happened recently where Justice Ginsburg made some very, very inappropriate statements toward me and toward a tremendous number of people, many, many millions of people that I represent.	/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/government;/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/politics;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/society/racism;/art and entertainment/shows and events
44	TRUMP	And she was forced to apologize.	/society/unrest and war;/society/social institution/divorce;/law, govt and politics;/family and parenting/children;/law, govt and politics/politics;/business and industrial/business operations;/travel/transports;/travel/traveling with kids
45	TRUMP	And apologize she did.	/society;/law, govt and politics;/family and parenting/babies and toddlers;/society/racism;/society/dating;/pets/large animals;/sports/paintball;/sports/go kart;/sports/wrestling;/society/teens
46	TRUMP	But these were statements that should never, ever have been made.	/law, govt and politics;/society/crime/personal offense;/society/crime/personal offense/homicide;/law, govt and politics/law enforcement;/law, govt and politics/government
47	TRUMP	We need a Supreme Court that in my opinion is going to uphold the Second Amendment, and all amendments, but the Second Amendment, which is under absolute siege.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/legislative;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary
48	TRUMP	I believe if my opponent should win this race, which I truly don't think will happen, we will have a Second Amendment which will be a very, very small replica of what it is right now.	/sports/auto racing/nascar;/automotive and vehicles/auto parts;/automotive and vehicles/cars/car culture;/sports/boat racing;/law, govt and politics/government;/automotive and vehicles/cars/performance vehicles;/automotive and vehicles/buying and selling cars;/automotive and vehicles/cars/vintage cars
49	TRUMP	But I feel that it's absolutely important that we uphold, because of the fact that it is under such trauma.	/health and fitness/disorders/mental disorder/panic and anxiety;/family and parenting/children;/health and fitness/therapy;/law, govt and politics;/health and fitness/incest and abuse support;/education/homework and study tips;/society;/society/unrest and war;/health and fitness/sexuality;/art and entertainment/shows and events
50	TRUMP	I feel that the justices that I am going to appoint -- and I've named 20 of them -- the justices that I'm going to appoint will be pro-life.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary
51	TRUMP	They will have a conservative bent.	/law, govt and politics/politics/domestic policy;/society/welfare/healthcare;/society/work;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections;/society/work/unemployment;/religion and spirituality/judaism;/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/politics/political parties;/religion and spirituality/christianity/orthodoxy;/society/gay life
52	TRUMP	They will be protecting the Second Amendment.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/legislative;/law, govt and politics/government/parliament
53	TRUMP	They are great scholars in all cases, and they're people of tremendous respect.	/religion and spirituality/hinduism;/health and fitness/disease;/law, govt and politics;/health and fitness/disease/epidemic;/family and parenting/children;/society;/health and fitness/disease/cold and flu;/religion and spirituality/islam;/society/crime/personal offense;/religion and spirituality/christianity
54	TRUMP	They will interpret the Constitution the way the founders wanted it interpreted.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary;/law, govt and politics/government/parliament
55	TRUMP	And I believe that's very, very important.	/religion and spirituality/christianity;/religion and spirituality/islam;/religion and spirituality/christianity/protestantism;/law, govt and politics/politics;/religion and spirituality/christianity/orthodoxy;/religion and spirituality/christianity/latter-day saints;/society/sex;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/education/homework and study tips;/family and parenting/children
56	TRUMP	I don't think we should have justices appointed that decide what they want to hear.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary
57	TRUMP	It's all about the Constitution of -- of -- and so important, the Constitution the way it was meant to be.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/parliament;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary
58	TRUMP	And those are the people that I will appoint.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/parliament;/law, govt and politics/government/executive branch;/law, govt and politics/government/heads of state
59	WALLACE	Mr. Trump, thank you.	/real estate;/law, govt and politics/immigration;/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/executive branch;/society/racism;/society/gay life
60	WALLACE	We now have about 10 minutes for an open discussion.	/sports/tennis
61	WALLACE	I want to focus on two issues that, in fact, by the justices that you name could end up changing the existing law of the land.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary;/law, govt and politics/government/parliament
62	WALLACE	First is one that you mentioned, Mr. Trump, and that is guns.	/travel/transports;/travel/transports/sea travel;/law, govt and politics;/real estate;/law, govt and politics/immigration;/law, govt and politics/armed forces/navy
63	WALLACE	Secretary Clinton, you said last year, let me quote, "The Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment."	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary
64	WALLACE	And now, in fact, in the 2008 Heller case, the court ruled that there is a constitutional right to bear arms, but a right that is reasonably limited.	/law, govt and politics/government;/society/crime;/society/crime/personal offense;/society/crime/property crime;/law, govt and politics/government/legislative;/business and industrial/war industry;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement
65	WALLACE	Those were the words of the Judge Antonin Scalia who wrote the decision.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary;/law, govt and politics/government/executive branch;/law, govt and politics/government/legislative;/society/crime/property crime/fraud
66	WALLACE	What's wrong with that?	/society;/society/sex;/law, govt and politics;/sports/go kart;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/health and fitness/sexuality;/health and fitness/incest and abuse support;/style and fashion/body art;/family and parenting/children;/society/senior living
67	CLINTON	Well, first of all, I support the Second Amendment.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/legislative
68	CLINTON	I lived in Arkansas for 18 wonderful years.	/science/weather/meteorological disaster/tornado;/society/senior living;/law, govt and politics;/family and parenting/children;/law, govt and politics/government;/education/teaching and classroom resources;/law, govt and politics/government/state and local government;/education/teaching and classroom resources/school supplies;/society/dating;/religion and spirituality/judaism
69	CLINTON	I represented upstate New York.	/business and industrial/business news;/law, govt and politics/government;/news/national news;/business and industrial/company/merger and acquisition;/society/gay life;/law, govt and politics/immigration;/real estate/buying and selling homes;/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/law, govt and politics/government/legislative;/real estate/low income housing
70	CLINTON	I understand and respect the tradition of gun ownership.	/real estate/buying and selling homes;/religion and spirituality/hinduism;/law, govt and politics/politics;/family and parenting/children;/religion and spirituality/buddhism;/news;/society;/religion and spirituality/christianity;/religion and spirituality/christianity/orthodoxy;/business and industrial/business news
71	CLINTON	It goes back to the founding of our country.	/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/politics;/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/immigration;/law, govt and politics/politics/political parties;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/society/work/unemployment;/law, govt and politics/government/heads of state
72	CLINTON	But I also believe that there can be and must be reasonable regulation.	/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/society/crime/property crime;/finance/financial news;/finance/bank/checks;/family and parenting/children;/health and fitness/exercise;/religion and spirituality/christianity;/law, govt and politics/government/legislative;/society/crime/property crime/fraud
73	CLINTON	Because I support the Second Amendment doesn't mean that I want people who shouldn't have guns to be able to threaten you, kill you or members of your family.	/law, govt and politics/government;/travel/transports;/society/crime/personal offense/assault;/travel/transports/sea travel;/society/unrest and war;/travel/traveling with kids;/family and parenting;/law, govt and politics/government/legislative;/style and fashion/body art;/society/crime/personal offense/homicide
74	CLINTON	And so when I think about what we need to do, we have 33,000 people a year who die from guns.	/travel/transports;/travel/transports/sea travel;/education/homework and study tips;/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/immigration;/health and fitness;/society;/education/teaching and classroom resources;/education/teaching and classroom resources/school supplies
75	CLINTON	I think we need comprehensive background checks, need to close the online loophole, close the gun show loophole.	/technology and computing/internet technology;/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/law enforcement;/society/crime/property crime;/education/homework and study tips;/education/teaching and classroom resources;/law, govt and politics/government;/technology and computing/internet technology/internet cafes;/technology and computing/internet technology/social network;/family and parenting/children
76	CLINTON	There's other matters that I think are sensible that are the kind of reforms that would make a difference that are not in any way conflicting with the Second Amendment.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/politics;/law, govt and politics/government/legislative;/law, govt and politics/government/parliament;/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary
77	CLINTON	You mentioned the Heller decision.	/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/society;/health and fitness/exercise;/law, govt and politics/government/legislative
78	CLINTON	And what I was saying that you referenced, Chris, was that I disagreed with the way the court applied the Second Amendment in that case, because what the District of Columbia was trying to do was to protect toddlers from guns and so they wanted people with guns to safely store them.	/family and parenting/babies and toddlers/baby food;/law, govt and politics/government;/travel/transports
79	CLINTON	And the court didn't accept that reasonable regulation, but they've accepted many others.	/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary;/society/crime/property crime/fraud;/finance/financial news;/finance/bank/checks;/health and fitness/exercise;/law, govt and politics/government/legislative;/society/crime/personal offense
80	CLINTON	So I see no conflict between saving people's lives and defending the Second Amendment.	/law, govt and politics/government;/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/politics;/law, govt and politics/government/parliament;/law, govt and politics/politics/political parties;/law, govt and politics/government/legislative
81	WALLACE	Let me bring Mr. Trump in here.	/law, govt and politics/immigration;/real estate;/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/real estate/buying and selling homes;/law, govt and politics/government/executive branch;/travel/traveling with kids;/society/racism;/business and industrial/business news;/news
82	WALLACE	The bipartisan Open Debate Coalition got millions of votes on questions to ask here, and this was, in fact, one of the top questions that they got.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections;/law, govt and politics/politics/political parties;/law, govt and politics/government/parliament;/law, govt and politics/government/legislative;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/local elections;/society/unrest and war
83	WALLACE	How will you ensure the Second Amendment is protected?	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/legislative;/law, govt and politics/government/parliament
84	WALLACE	You just heard Secretary Clinton's answer.	/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections;/law, govt and politics/government
85	WALLACE	Does she persuade you that, while you may disagree on regulation, that, in fact, she supports a Second Amendment right to bear arms?	/law, govt and politics;/business and industrial/war industry;/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/politics/lobbying;/society/crime/personal offense/hate crime;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement
86	TRUMP	Well, the D.C. vs. Heller decision was very strongly -- and she was extremely angry about it.	/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/government;/business and industrial/construction;/real estate/buying and selling homes;/society;/family and parenting/parenting teens;/travel/traveling with kids;/society/dating;/society/work;/society/senior living
87	TRUMP	I watched.	
88	TRUMP	I mean, she was very, very angry when upheld.	/society/social institution/divorce;/law, govt and politics;/society/crime/property crime;/law, govt and politics/government;/family and parenting/children;/family and parenting/babies and toddlers
89	TRUMP	And Justice Scalia was so involved.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/executive branch;/society/crime
90	TRUMP	And it was a well-crafted decision.	/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/law, govt and politics/government/legislative;/law, govt and politics/government/parliament;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary
91	TRUMP	But Hillary was extremely upset, extremely angry.	/society/dating;/family and parenting/babies and toddlers;/travel/traveling with kids;/sports/tennis;/sports/go kart;/family and parenting/parenting teens;/travel/honeymoons and getaways;/family and parenting/children;/pets/large animals;/style and fashion/body art
92	TRUMP	And people that believe in the Second Amendment and believe in it very strongly were very upset with what she had to say.	/law, govt and politics/government;/religion and spirituality/christianity;/society/sex;/religion and spirituality/islam;/society/social institution/divorce;/law, govt and politics/politics;/religion and spirituality/christianity/latter-day saints;/society/social institution/marriage;/law, govt and politics/politics/lobbying
93	WALLACE	Well, let me bring in Secretary Clinton.	/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections
94	WALLACE	Were you extremely upset?	/sports/tennis;/society/dating
95	CLINTON	Well, I was upset because, unfortunately, dozens of toddlers injure themselves, even kill people with guns, because, unfortunately, not everyone who has loaded guns in their homes takes appropriate precautions.	/family and parenting/babies and toddlers/baby food;/travel/transports;/travel/transports/sea travel
96	CLINTON	But there's no doubt that I respect the Second Amendment, that I also believe there's an individual right to bear arms.	/law, govt and politics/government;/society;/law, govt and politics/politics/lobbying;/society/crime/personal offense/homicide;/society/crime/personal offense/hate crime;/law, govt and politics/government/legislative
97	CLINTON	That is not in conflict with sensible, commonsense regulation.	/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics;/business and industrial/war industry;/law, govt and politics/politics;/finance/financial news
98	CLINTON	And, you know, look, I understand that Donald's been strongly supported by the NRA.	/family and parenting/children;/law, govt and politics/politics/lobbying;/society/work;/style and fashion;/law, govt and politics/government;/family and parenting/babies and toddlers/baby clothes;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/family and parenting/parenting teens;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections;/law, govt and politics/politics/foreign policy
99	CLINTON	The gun lobby's on his side.	/sports/hunting and shooting;/sports/hunting and shooting/target shooting;/society/crime/personal offense/homicide;/automotive and vehicles/vehicle brands;/real estate/buying and selling homes;/society/crime/personal offense/assault;/law, govt and politics;/real estate/architects
100	CLINTON	They're running millions of dollars of ads against me.	/business and industrial/advertising and marketing/advertising;/business and industrial/advertising and marketing/marketing
101	CLINTON	And I regret that, because what I would like to see is for people to come together and say: Of course we're going to protect and defend the Second Amendment.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/executive branch;/law, govt and politics/government/parliament
102	CLINTON	But we're going to do it in a way that tries to save some of these 33,000 lives that we lose every year.	/art and entertainment/shows and events;/health and fitness/weight loss;/family and parenting;/family and parenting/parenting teens;/art and entertainment/shows and events/sports event;/society;/family and parenting/babies and toddlers/baby clothes;/family and parenting/children;/sports/go kart;/art and entertainment/shows and events/festival
103	WALLACE	Let me bring Mr. Trump back into this, because, in fact, you oppose any limits on assault weapons, any limits on high- capacity magazines.	/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/law enforcement;/law, govt and politics/immigration;/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/real estate/buying and selling homes;/society/sex
104	WALLACE	You support a national right to carry law.	/news/national news;/law, govt and politics
105	WALLACE	Why, sir?	
106	TRUMP	Well, let me just tell you before we go any further.	/society/social institution/divorce;/family and parenting/babies and toddlers/baby clothes;/society/dating
107	TRUMP	In Chicago, which has the toughest gun laws in the United States, probably you could say by far, they have more gun violence than any other city.	/society/crime/personal offense/homicide;/sports/hunting and shooting;/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/law enforcement;/society/crime/personal offense/hate crime;/society/crime/property crime/larceny;/sports/hunting and shooting/target shooting;/law, govt and politics/government
108	TRUMP	So we have the toughest laws, and you have tremendous gun violence.	/law, govt and politics;/society/crime;/society/crime/personal offense/homicide;/sports/hunting and shooting;/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/law enforcement;/law, govt and politics/government/legislative;/society/sex;/society/crime/personal offense/hate crime;/society/crime/sexual offence/prostitution
109	TRUMP	I am a very strong supporter of the Second Amendment.	/law, govt and politics/government
110	TRUMP	And I am -- I don't know if Hillary was saying it in a sarcastic manner, but I'm very proud to have the endorsement of the NRA.	/sports/hunting and shooting;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections;/law, govt and politics/government;/sports/hunting and shooting/target shooting;/law, govt and politics/politics/foreign policy;/law, govt and politics/politics/lobbying;/society/gay life;/society/work;/family and parenting;/law, govt and politics/government/legislative
111	TRUMP	And it's the earliest endorsement they've ever given to anybody who ran for president.	/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections;/law, govt and politics/government;/society/dating;/art and entertainment/movies and tv/movies/reviews
112	TRUMP	So I'm very honored by all of that.	/art and entertainment/shows and events/concert;/art and entertainment/movies;/society/gay life;/art and entertainment/celebrity fan and gossip;/art and entertainment/movies/film festivals and awards;/careers/career planning;/careers/job fairs;/sports/baseball;/art and entertainment/shows and events/classical concert;/family and parenting/parenting teens
113	TRUMP	We are going to appoint justices -- this is the best way to help the Second Amendment.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary
114	TRUMP	We are going to appoint justices that will feel very strongly about the Second Amendment, that will not do damage to the Second Amendment.	/law, govt and politics/government
115	WALLACE	Well, let's pick up on another issue which divides you and the justices that whoever ends up winning this election appoints could have a dramatic effect there, and that's the issue of abortion.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary;/society/sex;/society/sex/sex education
116	TRUMP	Right.	
117	WALLACE	Mr. Trump, you're pro-life.	/law, govt and politics/immigration;/law, govt and politics/government;/society/sex/sex education;/real estate;/society/gay life;/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/law, govt and politics/government/executive branch;/society/racism;/news/national news;/art and entertainment/shows and events
118	WALLACE	But I want to ask you specifically: Do you want the court, including the justices that you will name, to overturn Roe v. Wade, which includes -- in fact, states -- a woman's right to abortion?	/family and parenting/motherhood/pregnancy;/society/sex/sex education;/law, govt and politics/government;/health and fitness/women's health;/health and fitness/incest and abuse support
119	TRUMP	Well, if that would happen, because I am pro-life, and I will be appointing pro-life judges, I would think that that will go back to the individual states.	/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary;/society/sex/sex education
120	WALLACE	But I'm asking you specifically.	/family and parenting/children;/law, govt and politics;/society;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/society/sex;/health and fitness/sexuality;/society/gay life;/family and parenting/babies and toddlers/baby clothes;/family and parenting/parenting teens;/health and fitness/addiction
121	WALLACE	Would you like to...	/art and entertainment/shows and events/classical concert;/art and entertainment/shows and events/concert;/art and entertainment/movies and tv/movies/reviews;/art and entertainment/music/music reference;/law, govt and politics/politics;/religion and spirituality/islam;/art and entertainment/movies and tv/action;/news;/art and entertainment/music/singing;/religion and spirituality/atheism and agnosticism
122	TRUMP	If they overturned it, it will go back to the states.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/legislative;/society;/law, govt and politics/government/executive branch;/society/crime
123	WALLACE	But what I'm asking you, sir, is, do you want to see the court overturn -- you just said you want to see the court protect the Second Amendment.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary;/law, govt and politics/government/legislative
124	WALLACE	Do you want to see the court overturn Roe v. Wade?	/family and parenting/motherhood/pregnancy;/society/sex/sex education;/law, govt and politics/government;/health and fitness/incest and abuse support;/health and fitness/women's health;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary
125	TRUMP	Well, if we put another two or perhaps three justice on, that's really what's going to be -- that will happen.	/art and entertainment/shows and events;/society/dating;/sports/go kart;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary;/family and parenting/parenting teens;/society/senior living;/family and parenting/children;/society/unrest and war;/society/teens;/style and fashion
126	TRUMP	And that'll happen automatically, in my opinion, because I am putting pro-life justices on the court.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary
127	TRUMP	I will say this: It will go back to the states, and the states will then make a determination.	/law, govt and politics/government;/family and parenting/children;/society/social institution/divorce;/society/unrest and war;/society/crime/property crime;/law, govt and politics/government/executive branch;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/law, govt and politics/politics
128	WALLACE	Secretary Clinton?	/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections
129	CLINTON	Well, I strongly support Roe v. Wade, which guarantees a constitutional right to a woman to make the most intimate, most difficult, in many cases, decisions about her health care that one can imagine.	/law, govt and politics/government;/society/sex/sex education;/health and fitness/women's health;/health and fitness/drugs;/health and fitness/men's health;/health and fitness/incest and abuse support;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary;/law, govt and politics/government/legislative
130	CLINTON	And in this case, it's not only about Roe v. Wade.	/family and parenting/motherhood/pregnancy;/society/sex/sex education;/law, govt and politics/government;/health and fitness/incest and abuse support;/health and fitness/women's health;/health and fitness/drugs
131	CLINTON	It is about what's happening right now in America.	/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/politics;/society;/law, govt and politics/immigration;/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/society/unrest and war;/society/racism;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/news/national news
132	CLINTON	So many states are putting very stringent regulations on women that block them from exercising that choice to the extent that they are defunding Planned Parenthood, which, of course, provides all kinds of cancer screenings and other benefits for women in our country.	/health and fitness/women's health;/society/welfare/healthcare;/society/sex;/family and parenting/motherhood/pregnancy;/law, govt and politics;/health and fitness/sexuality;/society/sex/sex education
133	CLINTON	Donald has said he's in favor of defunding Planned Parenthood.	/society/sex/sex education;/law, govt and politics/government;/health and fitness/women's health;/health and fitness/incest and abuse support;/society/unrest and war
134	CLINTON	He even supported shutting the government down to defund Planned Parenthood.	/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/politics;/society/sex/sex education;/law, govt and politics/government/parliament;/law, govt and politics/politics/political parties;/society/work
135	CLINTON	I will defend Planned Parenthood.	/society/sex/sex education;/health and fitness/women's health;/law, govt and politics/government;/society/unrest and war
136	CLINTON	I will defend Roe v. Wade, and I will defend women's rights to make their own health care decisions.	/health and fitness/women's health
137	WALLACE	Secretary Clinton…	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/politics;/law, govt and politics/government/executive branch;/society/welfare/healthcare;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/finance;/law, govt and politics/government/state and local government;/law, govt and politics/politics/domestic policy;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections;/law, govt and politics/politics/foreign policy
138	CLINTON	And we have come too far to have that turned back now.	/travel/transports;/travel/transports/sea travel;/society/unrest and war
139	WALLACE	And, indeed, he said women should be punished, that there should be some form of punishment for women who obtain abortions.	/health and fitness/women's health;/family and parenting/motherhood/pregnancy;/society/sex;/society/crime;/society/crime/sexual offence/rape;/society/sex/sex education;/health and fitness/incest and abuse support;/society/crime/sexual offence/prostitution
140	WALLACE	And I could just not be more opposed to that kind of thinking.	/law, govt and politics/politics;/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/government;/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/society/work;/society/social institution/divorce
141	WALLACE	I'm going to give you a chance to respond, but I want to ask you, Secretary Clinton, I want to explore how far you believe the right to abortion goes.	/society/sex;/society/sex/sex education;/family and parenting;/health and fitness/women's health;/law, govt and politics/government;/family and parenting/children;/health and fitness/incest and abuse support;/health and fitness/sexuality;/family and parenting/babies and toddlers
142	WALLACE	You have been quoted as saying that the fetus has no constitutional rights.	/family and parenting/babies and toddlers;/law, govt and politics/government;/health and fitness/disease/infertility;/family and parenting/children;/health and fitness/disease/thyroid disease;/society;/health and fitness/women's health;/health and fitness/incest and abuse support;/health and fitness/disease/diabetes;/society/sex
143	WALLACE	You also voted against a ban on late-term, partial-birth abortions.	/society/sex/sex education;/health and fitness/women's health;/law, govt and politics/government;/health and fitness/incest and abuse support;/society/gay life;/family and parenting
144	WALLACE	Why?	
145	CLINTON	Because Roe v. Wade very clearly sets out that there can be regulations on abortion so long as the life and the health of the mother are taken into account.	/family and parenting/motherhood/pregnancy;/health and fitness/men's health;/society/sex/sex education;/health and fitness/women's health;/law, govt and politics/government
146	CLINTON	And when I voted as a senator, I did not think that that was the case.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections
147	CLINTON	The kinds of cases that fall at the end of pregnancy are often the most heartbreaking, painful decisions for families to make.	/health and fitness/disease/infertility;/family and parenting;/family and parenting/children;/family and parenting/babies and toddlers;/society/sex;/health and fitness/disease/thyroid disease;/society/sex/sex education;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary;/health and fitness/therapy
148	CLINTON	I have met with women who toward the end of their pregnancy get the worst news one could get, that their health is in jeopardy if they continue to carry to term or that something terrible has happened or just been discovered about the pregnancy.	/family and parenting/motherhood/pregnancy
149	CLINTON	I do not think the United States government should be stepping in and making those most personal of decisions.	/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/law, govt and politics/politics;/law, govt and politics/government/parliament;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary;/society/unrest and war;/society/work/unemployment
150	CLINTON	So you can regulate if you are doing so with the life and the health of the mother taken into account.	/health and fitness/men's health
151	WALLACE	Mr. Trump, your reaction?	/science/chemistry/organic chemistry
152	WALLACE	And particularly on this issue of late-term, partial-birth abortions.	/family and parenting/motherhood/pregnancy;/society/sex/sex education
153	TRUMP	Well, I think it's terrible.	/society/social institution/divorce;/society/unrest and war;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/sports/hunting and shooting;/style and fashion;/family and parenting/parenting teens;/society/dating;/law, govt and politics/government;/art and entertainment/books and literature;/health and fitness/sexuality
154	TRUMP	If you go with what Hillary is saying, in the ninth month, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby.	/family and parenting/babies and toddlers;/society/social institution/divorce
155	TRUMP	Now, you can say that that's OK and Hillary can say that that's OK.	/society/social institution/divorce;/law, govt and politics;/society/sex;/family and parenting/children;/news;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/society/gay life;/family and parenting/babies and toddlers/baby clothes;/health and fitness/incest and abuse support
156	TRUMP	But it's not OK with me, because based on what she's saying, and based on where she's going, and where she's been, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month on the final day.	/family and parenting/babies and toddlers
157	TRUMP	And that's not acceptable.	/sports/scuba diving;/sports/diving;/society/sex;/style and fashion/clothing;/society/social institution;/society/social institution/marriage;/health and fitness/sexuality;/society/social institution/divorce;/family and parenting/children
158	CLINTON	Well, that is not what happens in these cases.	/health and fitness/disease;/health and fitness/disease/epidemic;/health and fitness/disease/cold and flu;/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary;/family and parenting/children;/society/crime/personal offense;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/society/crime/sexual offence/rape;/health and fitness/incest and abuse support
159	CLINTON	And using that kind of scare rhetoric is just terribly unfortunate.	/law, govt and politics/politics;/society/unrest and war;/art and entertainment/books and literature;/family and parenting;/style and fashion/body art;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/society/racism;/family and parenting/parenting teens;/art and entertainment/books and literature/poetry;/education/teaching and classroom resources
160	CLINTON	You should meet with some of the women that I have met with, women I have known over the course of my life.	/health and fitness/women's health;/society/sex;/family and parenting/motherhood;/health and fitness/sexuality
161	CLINTON	This is one of the worst possible choices that any woman and her family has to make.	/family and parenting;/society/social institution/divorce;/family and parenting/children;/society/social institution/marriage;/family and parenting/motherhood/pregnancy;/society/sex;/health and fitness/sexuality;/health and fitness/women's health;/family and parenting/babies and toddlers/baby clothes;/society/dating

219	WALLACE	Basically, why are you right and Mr. Trump is wrong?	/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections
220	CLINTON	Well, as he was talking, I was thinking about a young girl I met here in Las Vegas, Carla, who is very worried that her parents might be deported, because she was born in this country but they were not.	/family and parenting/children;/law, govt and politics/immigration;/society/unrest and war;/travel/traveling with kids;/religion and spirituality/judaism;/family and parenting/babies and toddlers;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/family and parenting/adoption;/society/dating
221	CLINTON	They work hard, they do everything they can to give her a good life.	/society/social institution/divorce;/family and parenting/children;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/society/senior living;/style and fashion/body art;/family and parenting/babies and toddlers/baby clothes;/pets/large animals;/society/dating;/religion and spirituality/hinduism
222	CLINTON	And you're right.	/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/society;/society/sex;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/law, govt and politics/politics;/society/gay life
223	CLINTON	I don't want to rip families apart.	/family and parenting;/family and parenting/children;/society/social institution/divorce
224	CLINTON	I don't want to be sending parents away from children.	/family and parenting/children
225	CLINTON	I don't want to see the deportation force that Donald has talked about in action in our country.	/law, govt and politics/immigration;/religion and spirituality/judaism;/society/crime/personal offense;/society/unrest and war;/society/crime/personal offense/assault;/travel/transports
226	CLINTON	We have 11 million undocumented people.	/law, govt and politics/immigration;/finance/grants, scholarships and financial aid;/finance/grants, scholarships and financial aid/financial aid;/finance/investing/funds;/business and industrial/company
227	CLINTON	They have 4 million American citizen children, 15 million people.	/family and parenting/children
228	CLINTON	He said as recently as a few weeks ago in Phoenix that every undocumented person would be subject to deportation.	/law, govt and politics/immigration;/society/crime/personal offense
229	CLINTON	Now, here's what that means.	/law, govt and politics/politics;/business and industrial/business operations/management/business process;/religion and spirituality/hinduism;/family and parenting/children;/society;/technology and computing/internet technology/web search/people search;/style and fashion/body art;/society/senior living;/technology and computing/enterprise technology;/society/unrest and war
230	CLINTON	It means you would have to have a massive law enforcement presence, where law enforcement officers would be going school to school, home to home, business to business, rounding up people who are undocumented.	/law, govt and politics/law enforcement;/business and industrial;/education/school;/business and industrial/business operations/management/business process
231	CLINTON	And we would then have to put them on trains, on buses to get them out of our country.	/automotive and vehicles/road-side assistance;/automotive and vehicles/cars;/business and industrial/construction;/automotive and vehicles/cars/hybrid;/travel/business travel;/sports/running and jogging;/automotive and vehicles/cars/performance vehicles;/automotive and vehicles/cars/diesel;/automotive and vehicles/electric vehicles;/automotive and vehicles/commercial vehicles
232	CLINTON	I think that is an idea that is not in keeping with who we are as a nation.	/law, govt and politics/politics;/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/government;/religion and spirituality;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/law, govt and politics/politics/foreign policy
233	CLINTON	I think it's an idea that would rip our country apart.	/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/politics;/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/law, govt and politics/immigration;/religion and spirituality;/society/work/unemployment;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/style and fashion
234	CLINTON	I have been for border security for years.	/law, govt and politics/immigration;/law, govt and politics/law enforcement;/society/crime/drug trafficking
235	CLINTON	I voted for border security in the United States Senate.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections;/law, govt and politics/immigration;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections;/law, govt and politics/law enforcement
236	CLINTON	And my comprehensive immigration reform plan of course includes border security.	/law, govt and politics/immigration;/law, govt and politics/government
237	CLINTON	But I want to put our resources where I think they're most needed: Getting rid of any violent person.	/education/teaching and classroom resources
238	CLINTON	Anybody who should be deported, we should deport them.	/law, govt and politics/immigration;/religion and spirituality/judaism;/society/racism
239	CLINTON	When it comes to the wall that Donald talks about building, he went to Mexico, he had a meeting with the Mexican president.	/law, govt and politics;/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/government/heads of state;/law, govt and politics/immigration;/education/teaching and classroom resources;/business and industrial/construction;/education/teaching and classroom resources/school supplies;/law, govt and politics/politics
240	CLINTON	Didn't even raise it.	/finance/investing/funds;/real estate/buying and selling homes;/society/work;/finance/financial news;/finance/investing/beginning investing;/society/work/unemployment;/finance/bank;/law, govt and politics;/finance/grants, scholarships and financial aid;/education/special education
241	CLINTON	He choked and then got into a Twitter war because the Mexican president said we're not paying for that wall.	/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/immigration;/finance/financial news;/education/teaching and classroom resources;/law, govt and politics/government
242	CLINTON	So I think we are both a nation of immigrants and we are a nation of laws and that we can act accordingly.	/law, govt and politics/immigration;/law, govt and politics/government
243	CLINTON	And that's why I'm introducing comprehensive immigration reform within the first 100 days with the path to citizenship.	/law, govt and politics/immigration
244	WALLACE	Thank you, Secretary Clinton.	/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections

256	TRUMP	Hillary Clinton fought for the wall in 2006 or thereabouts.	/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections
257	TRUMP	Now, she never gets anything done, so naturally the wall wasn't built.	/society/dating;/sports/go kart;/family and parenting/babies and toddlers/baby clothes;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/business and industrial/construction;/style and fashion/body art;/family and parenting/parenting teens;/family and parenting/children;/food and drink;/society/senior living

265	WALLACE	I'd like to hear -- I'd like to hear from Secretary Clinton.	/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections;/law, govt and politics/government
266	CLINTON	I voted for border security, and there are...	/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/immigration;/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections;/law, govt and politics/law enforcement;/law, govt and politics/politics/domestic policy
267	TRUMP	And the wall.	/education/teaching and classroom resources;/education/school;/home and garden/bed and bath/bedroom;/education/teaching and classroom resources/school supplies
268	CLINTON	There are some limited places where that was appropriate.	/education/teaching and classroom resources;/family and parenting/children;/law, govt and politics;/education/studying business;/business and industrial/business operations/management/business process;/education/homework and study tips;/finance/financial news;/health and fitness;/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/automotive and vehicles/vehicle brands
269	CLINTON	There also is necessarily going to be new technology and how best to deploy that.	/technology and computing/internet technology;/technology and computing/enterprise technology;/business and industrial/business operations
270	CLINTON	But it is clear, when you look at what Donald has been proposing, he started his campaign bashing immigrants, calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals and drug dealers, that he has a very different view about what we should do to deal with immigrants.	/law, govt and politics/immigration;/society/crime/sexual offence/rape
271	CLINTON	Now, what I am also arguing is that bringing undocumented immigrants out from the shadows, putting them into the formal economy will be good, because then employers can't exploit them and undercut Americans' wages.	/society/work;/society/work/unemployment;/law, govt and politics/immigration;/society/welfare/healthcare;/law, govt and politics/politics

274	CLINTON	He underpaid undocumented workers, and when they complained, he basically said what a lot of employers do: "You complain, I'll get you deported."	/society/work;/law, govt and politics/immigration;/society/work/unions
275	CLINTON	I want to get everybody out of the shadows, get the economy working, and not let employers like Donald exploit undocumented workers, which hurts them, but also hurts American workers.	/society/work;/society/work/unemployment
276	WALLACE	Mr. Trump?

322	CLINTON	Then they have given that information to WikiLeaks for the purpose of putting it on the Internet.	/technology and computing/internet technology;/technology and computing/internet technology/internet cafes
323	CLINTON	This has come from the highest levels of the Russian government, clearly, from Putin himself, in an effort, as 17 of our intelligence agencies have confirmed, to influence our election.	/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections;/law, govt and politics/espionage and intelligence/terrorism;/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections;/law, govt and politics/politics/foreign policy;/law, govt and politics/politics/political parties;/technology and computing/computer crime;/law, govt and politics/government/heads of state
324	CLINTON	So I actually think the most important question of this evening, Chris, is, finally, will Donald Trump admit and condemn that the Russians are doing this and make it clear that he will not have the help of Putin in in this election, that he rejects Russian espionage against Americans, which he actually encouraged in the past?	/law, govt and politics/espionage and intelligence

458	WALLACE	You also have very different ideas about how to get the economy growing faster.	/society/work/unemployment;/law, govt and politics/politics;/business and industrial/agriculture and forestry/agriculture
459	WALLACE	Secretary Clinton, in your plan, government plays a big role.	/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections;/art and entertainment/theatre;/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/law, govt and politics/politics/foreign policy;/law, govt and politics/armed forces
460	WALLACE	You see more government spending, more entitlements, more tax credits, more tax penalties.	/society/welfare/healthcare;/society/work/unemployment;/real estate/buying and selling homes
461	WALLACE	Mr. Trump, you want to get government out with lower taxes and less regulation.	/society/welfare/healthcare;/society/work/unemployment;/finance/financial news

465	WALLACE	In this round, you go first, Secretary Clinton.	/sports/go kart;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections
466	CLINTON	Well, I think when the middle class thrives, America thrives.	/law, govt and politics/politics;/society/work/unemployment;/society/unrest and war;/family and parenting;/law, govt and politics/immigration;/society/racism;/style and fashion;/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/politics/foreign policy;/art and entertainment/shows and events
467	CLINTON	And so my plan is based on growing the economy, giving middle-class families many more opportunities.	/society/work/unemployment;/law, govt and politics/politics
468	CLINTON	I want us to have the biggest jobs program since World War II, jobs in infrastructure and advanced manufacturing.	/business and industrial/manufacturing

470	CLINTON	New jobs and clean energy, not only to fight climate change, which is a serious problem, but to create new opportunities and new businesses.	/business and industrial/energy/renewable energy;/business and industrial/green solutions
471	CLINTON	I want us to do more to help small business.	/business and industrial;/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/finance/financial news;/business and industrial/business news;/business and industrial/logistics;/business and industrial/business software
472	CLINTON	That's where two- thirds of the new jobs are going to come from.	/society/work/unemployment;/education/homework and study tips;/careers/job search
473	CLINTON	I want us to raise the national minimum wage, because people who live in poverty should not -- who work full-time should not still be in poverty.	/society/work/unemployment;/society/welfare;/society/welfare/healthcare;/family and parenting/children
474	CLINTON	And I sure do want to make sure women get equal pay for the work we do.	/health and fitness/women's health;/society/social institution/divorce;/society/sex;/family and parenting;/family and parenting/motherhood
475	CLINTON	I feel strongly that we have to have an education system that starts with preschool and goes through college.	/family and parenting/children/daycare and preschool
476	CLINTON	That's why I want more technical education in high schools and in community colleges, real apprenticeships to prepare young people for the jobs of the future.	/education/high school;/education/special education;/education/studying business
477	CLINTON	I want to make college debt-free and for families making less than $125,000, you will not get a tuition bill from a public college or university if the plan that I worked on with Bernie Sanders is enacted.	/finance/grants, scholarships and financial aid;/finance/grants, scholarships and financial aid/financial aid;/law, govt and politics/government;/education;/education/school/private school;/education/studying business;/finance/grants, scholarships and financial aid/scholarships;/education/alumni and reunions

479	CLINTON	Most of the gains in the last years since the Great Recession have gone to the very top.	/society/work/unemployment;/finance/bank;/real estate/buying and selling homes;/finance/investing;/finance/investing/beginning investing;/finance/financial news;/finance/investing/funds/mutual funds
480	CLINTON	So we are going to have the wealthy pay their fair share.	/society/work;/real estate/buying and selling homes;/finance/financial news;/society/work/unemployment;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/finance/investing/funds;/society/work/retirement;/finance/investing/options;/finance/investing/beginning investing;/business and industrial

482	CLINTON	That is a plan that has been analyzed by independent experts which said that it could produce 10 million new jobs.	/society/work/unemployment;/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/education/homework and study tips;/law, govt and politics;/business and industrial/construction;/careers/career planning;/finance/investing/funds;/business and industrial/business operations/management/business process;/finance/financial news
483	CLINTON	By contrast, Donald's plan has been analyzed to conclude it might lose 3.5 million jobs.	/society/work/unemployment;/education/homework and study tips;/law, govt and politics;/society/unrest and war
484	CLINTON	Why?	
485	CLINTON	Because his whole plan is to cut taxes, to give the biggest tax breaks ever to the wealthy and to corporations, adding $20 trillion to our debt, and causing the kind of dislocation that we have seen before, because it truly will be trickle-down economics on steroids.	/business and industrial/company/earnings;/finance/bank;/society/work/unemployment;/finance/investing;/finance/investing/beginning investing;/finance/financial news;/finance/investing/funds;/real estate/buying and selling homes;/finance/investing/funds/mutual funds;/business and industrial/company/bankruptcy

1199	TRUMP	And we're bringing GDP from, really, 1 percent, which is what it is now, and if she got in, it will be less than zero.	/society/work/unemployment;/finance/investing;/finance/investing/beginning investing;/finance/investing/funds
1200	TRUMP	But we're bringing it from 1 percent up to 4 percent.	/education/special education;/finance/grants, scholarships and financial aid/government grants;/finance/investing/funds;/education/high school;/society/work/unemployment

1203	TRUMP	And if we do, you don't have to bother asking your question, because we have a tremendous machine.	/technology and computing/hardware/computer;/technology and computing/hardware/computer peripherals;/technology and computing/hardware/computer/portable computer;/technology and computing/hardware/computer components;/technology and computing/hardware/computer peripherals/computer monitors;/law, govt and politics

1205	TRUMP	To do that, we're taking back jobs.	/society/work/unemployment;/education/homework and study tips

1224	WALLACE	Secretary Clinton?	/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections
1225	CLINTON	Well, first, when I hear Donald talk like that and know that his slogan is "Make America Great Again," I wonder when he thought America was great.	/business and industrial/advertising and marketing/advertising;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/law, govt and politics/immigration;/society/racism;/law, govt and politics/commentary;/family and parenting/children;/art and entertainment/shows and events/sports event;/real estate;/real estate/buying and selling homes;/business and industrial/business news
1226	CLINTON	And before he rushes and says, "You know, before you and President Obama were there," I think it's important to recognize that he has been criticizing our government for decades.	/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/politics/foreign policy;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/society/unrest and war;/society/social institution/divorce;/society/work;/society/gay life;/law, govt and politics/politics/lobbying
1227	CLINTON	You know, back in 1987, he took out a $100,000 ad in the New York Times, during the time when President Reagan was president, and basically said exactly what he just said now, that we were the laughingstock of the world.	/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/heads of state;/law, govt and politics/politics/foreign policy;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections;/business and industrial/advertising and marketing/advertising;/law, govt and politics/government/executive branch
1228	CLINTON	He was criticizing President Reagan.	/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/law, govt and politics/politics/foreign policy;/law, govt and politics/politics/domestic policy
1229	CLINTON	This is the way Donald thinks about himself, puts himself into, you know, the middle and says, "You know, I alone can fix it," as he said on the convention stage.	/family and parenting/children;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/family and parenting/babies and toddlers/baby clothes;/society;/society/dating;/news;/food and drink;/style and fashion/body art;/law, govt and politics/government;/family and parenting/parenting teens
1230	CLINTON	But if you look at the debt, which is the issue you asked about, Chris, I pay for everything I'm proposing.	/real estate/buying and selling homes;/finance/financial news;/finance/investing/funds;/society/work/unemployment;/finance/investing/beginning investing;/finance/bank;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/finance/bank/checks;/business and industrial/business news
1231	CLINTON	I do not add a penny to the national debt.	/news/national news
1232	CLINTON	I take that very seriously, because I do think it's one of the issues we've got to come to grips with.	/art and entertainment/comics and animation/comics;/law, govt and politics;/society;/law, govt and politics/politics;/health and fitness/sexuality
1233	CLINTON	So when I talk about how we're going to pay for education, how we're going to invest in infrastructure, how we're going to get the cost of prescription drugs down, and a lot of the other issues that people talk to me about all the time, I've made it very clear we are going where the money is.	/health and fitness/drugs
1234	CLINTON	We are going to ask the wealthy and corporations to pay their fair share.	/business and industrial/company/earnings;/society/work;/finance/financial news;/real estate/buying and selling homes;/finance/investing;/finance/investing/beginning investing;/law, govt and politics;/society/work/unemployment;/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/finance/investing/funds
1235	CLINTON	And there is no evidence whatsoever that that will slow down or diminish our growth.	/society/work/unemployment;/health and fitness;/finance/investing;/finance/investing/beginning investing;/business and industrial/manufacturing;/law, govt and politics;/business and industrial/paper industry;/society/crime/personal offense/homicide;/health and fitness/exercise;/business and industrial/war industry
1236	CLINTON	In fact, I think just the opposite.	/art and entertainment/movies and tv/action;/art and entertainment/movies and tv/romantic comedies;/art and entertainment/movies and tv/movies/reviews;/art and entertainment/movies and tv/bollywood;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/family and parenting/parenting teens;/law, govt and politics;/art and entertainment/movies and tv/comedies;/society/teens;/society/unrest and war

1238	CLINTON	We've got to get back to rebuilding the middle class, the families of America.	/family and parenting;/family and parenting/children

1241	CLINTON	I want to invest in your family.	/finance/investing;/finance/investing/beginning investing
1242	CLINTON	And I think that's the smartest way to grow the economy, to make the economy fairer.	/society/work/unemployment;/law, govt and politics/politics;/business and industrial/agriculture and forestry/agriculture
1243	CLINTON	And we just have a big disagreement about this.	/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/politics;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/law, govt and politics/government/heads of state;/society/work;/sports/basketball;/law, govt and politics/government/parliament;/family and parenting;/sports/hunting and shooting;/health and fitness/men's health

1253	WALLACE	Well, no, sir, because we're running out of time...	/sports/running and jogging

1262	WALLACE	The one last area I want to get into with you in this debate is the fact that the biggest driver of our debt is entitlements, which is 60 percent of all federal spending.	/society/work/unemployment;/finance/investing/funds;/law, govt and politics/government;/automotive and vehicles/auto parts;/finance/bank;/finance/investing/beginning investing;/finance/financial news;/real estate/buying and selling homes;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/education/special education
1263	WALLACE	Now, the Committee for federal -- a Responsible Federal Budget has looked at both of your plans and they say neither of you has a serious plan that is going to solve the fact that Medicare's going to run out of money in the 2020s, Social Security is going to run out of money in the 2030s, and at that time, recipients are going to take huge cuts in their benefits.	/society/welfare/healthcare
1264	WALLACE	So, in effect, the final question I want to ask you in this regard is -- and let me start with you, Mr. Trump, would President Trump make a deal to save Medicare and Social Security that included both tax increases and benefit cuts, in effect, a grand bargain on entitlements?	/society/welfare/healthcare
1265	TRUMP	I'm cutting taxes.	/society/welfare/healthcare;/society/work/unemployment;/finance/investing/funds;/real estate/buying and selling homes;/finance/financial news;/finance/investing/beginning investing;/law, govt and politics/government;/style and fashion/luxury goods;/finance/bank

1270	TRUMP	And one thing we have to do: Repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.	/law, govt and politics/government;/science;/health and fitness/drugs;/science/weather
1271	TRUMP	It's destroying our country.	/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/politics;/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/travel/transports;/law, govt and politics/immigration;/travel/transports/sea travel
1272	TRUMP	It's destroying our businesses, our small business and our big businesses.	/business and industrial;/business and industrial/business operations;/travel/business travel;/business and industrial/business news;/finance/financial news;/business and industrial/business operations/business plans
1273	TRUMP	We have to repeal and replace Obamacare.	/law, govt and politics/government;/health and fitness/drugs
1274	TRUMP	You take a look at the kind of numbers that that will cost us in the year '17, it is a disaster.	/science;/science/weather;/business and industrial/energy/electricity
1275	TRUMP	If we don't repeal and replace -- now, it's probably going to die of its own weight.	/health and fitness/weight loss;/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/parliament;/society/gay life;/society/dating;/automotive and vehicles/vehicle brands;/law, govt and politics/government/legislative;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement
1276	TRUMP	But Obamacare has to go.	/health and fitness/drugs;/law, govt and politics/government;/family and parenting/eldercare
1277	TRUMP	It's -- the premiums are going up 60 percent, 70 percent, 80 percent.	/education/special education;/finance/investing/funds;/finance/grants, scholarships and financial aid/government grants;/education/high school;/health and fitness/drugs;/finance/investing/beginning investing;/society/work;/society/work/unemployment;/real estate/buying and selling homes;/education/homework and study tips
1278	TRUMP	Next year they're going to go up over 100 percent.	/education/special education;/education/high school
1279	TRUMP	And I'm really glad that the premiums have started -- at least the people see what's happening, because she wants to keep Obamacare and she wants to make it even worse, and it can't get any worse.	/health and fitness/drugs;/law, govt and politics/government;/family and parenting/eldercare;/health and fitness/dental care;/health and fitness/men's health
1280	TRUMP	Bad health care at the most expensive price.	/health and fitness/men's health;/health and fitness/drugs;/health and fitness/dental care;/family and parenting/eldercare;/finance/investing/day trading
1281	TRUMP	We have to repeal and replace Obamacare.	/law, govt and politics/government;/health and fitness/drugs
1282	WALLACE	And, Secretary Clinton, same question, because at this point, Social Security and Medicare are going to run out, the trust funds are going to run out of money.	/society/welfare/healthcare;/finance/investing/funds
1283	WALLACE	Will you as president entertain -- will you consider a grand bargain, a deal that includes both tax increases and benefit cuts to try to save both programs?	/society/welfare/healthcare;/society/work;/society/work/unemployment
1284	CLINTON	Well, Chris, I am on record as saying that we need to put more money into the Social Security Trust Fund.	/finance/investing/funds;/finance/grants, scholarships and financial aid/government grants;/society/welfare/healthcare;/society/work
1285	CLINTON	That's part of my commitment to raise taxes on the wealthy.	/education/special education
1286	CLINTON	My Social Security payroll contribution will go up, as will Donald's, assuming he can't figure out how to get out of it.	/science/mathematics/algebra;/society/welfare/healthcare;/society/work/retirement;/society/work/unemployment;/science/biology
1287	CLINTON	But what we want to do is to replenish the Social Security Trust Fund...	/education/special education;/finance/grants, scholarships and financial aid/government grants;/society/welfare/healthcare;/education/high school

1289	CLINTON	by making sure that we have sufficient resources, and that will come from either raising the cap and/or finding other ways to get more money into it.	/education/teaching and classroom resources
1290	CLINTON	I will not cut benefits.	/society/welfare/healthcare;/society/work;/society/work/unemployment;/society/work/retirement;/health and fitness;/finance/investing/funds

1292	CLINTON	But what Donald is proposing with these massive tax cuts will result in a $20 trillion additional national debt.	/finance/bank;/society/work/unemployment;/finance/investing;/finance/investing/beginning investing;/finance/financial news;/finance/investing/funds;/finance/investing/funds/mutual funds
1293	CLINTON	That will have dire consequences for Social Security and Medicare.	/society/welfare/healthcare
1294	CLINTON	And I'll say something about the Affordable Care Act, which he wants to repeal.	/law, govt and politics/government;/health and fitness/drugs;/health and fitness/men's health
1295	CLINTON	The Affordable Care Act extended the solvency of the Medicare Trust Fund.	/health and fitness/drugs;/law, govt and politics/government;/family and parenting/eldercare;/health and fitness/men's health

163	SANDERS	First, Dana...	
164	BASH	when you said the whole business model was fraudulent?	/real estate/buying and selling homes;/finance/financial news;/business and industrial/company/earnings;/business and industrial/company/bankruptcy;/law, govt and politics;/business and industrial/business software;/finance/investing;/finance/investing/beginning investing;/business and industrial/business news;/finance/investing/funds

168	SANDERS	What Goldman Sachs acknowledged was, essentially, that they were selling fraudulent packages of subprime mortgage loans.	/finance/bank;/real estate/buying and selling homes;/finance/financial news;/finance/investing;/finance/investing/beginning investing;/finance/investing/funds;/finance/investing/funds/hedge fund;/business and industrial/company/earnings
169	SANDERS	Goldman Sachs was not the only bank, other banks, of course, did the same.	/finance/bank
170	SANDERS	Now, I don't need Dodd-Frank now to tell me that we have got to break up these banks, A, because they're based on fraudulent principles, and B, because when you have six financial institutions that have assets equivalent to 58% of the GFP of this country, they are just too big, too much concentration of wealth and power.	/finance/bank;/finance/investing/futures trading;/finance/financial news;/finance/investing/funds
171	BASH	But, Senator...	/law, govt and politics/government
172	SANDERS	The point is we have got to break them up so that they do not pose a systemic risk and so that we have a vibrant economy with a competitive financial system.	/finance/financial news;/finance/bank
173	BASH	But Senator, you didn't answer the specific question which is not just about breaking up the banks, but why allow the banks to do it themselves?	/finance/bank;/law, govt and politics/government
174	SANDERS	Because I'm not sure that the government should say is you are too big to fail.	/finance/bank;/finance/financial news

182	CLINTON	Dana, let me add here that there are two ways to at this under Dodd-Frank, which is after all the law we passed under President Obama, and I'm proud that Barney Frank, one of the authors, has endorsed me because what I have said continuously is, yes, sometimes the government may have to order certain actions.	/finance/investing/futures trading;/finance/bank;/law, govt and politics/government;/finance/financial news

193	BASH	Can you name one decision that she made as senator that shows that he favored banks because of the money she received?	/finance/bank;/law, govt and politics/government;/finance/financial news;/finance/investing/funds
194	SANDERS	Sure.	
195	SANDERS	Sure.	
196	SANDERS	The obvious decision is when the greed and recklessness and illegal behavior of wall street brought this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession -- the Great Depression of the '30s, when millions of people lost their jobs, and their homes, and their life savings, the obvious response to that is that you've got a bunch of fraudulent operators and that they have got to be broken up.	/society/work/unemployment;/society/crime/property crime/fraud;/finance/bank;/finance/financial news;/finance/investing;/finance/investing/beginning investing;/real estate/buying and selling homes;/law, govt and politics

542	BLITZER	Senator, I want you to respond, but I also want you to respond to this.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/legislative
543	BLITZER	You recently said you do not think crime victims should be able to sue gun makers for damages.	/society/crime
544	BLITZER	The daughter of the Sandy Hook Elementary School who was killed back in the 2012 mass shooting, says you owe her and families an apology.	/law, govt and politics/armed forces/veterans;/society/crime/personal offense/homicide;/society/crime/personal offense/assault;/family and parenting/children;/law, govt and politics/law enforcement;/law, govt and politics/government;/society/crime/personal offense/hate crime;/family and parenting/children/daycare and preschool;/family and parenting/parenting teens;/society/crime/sexual offence/paedophilia
545	BLITZER	Do you?	
546	SANDERS	What we need to do is to do everything that we can to make certain that guns do not fall into the hands of people who do not have them.	/law, govt and politics;/society/unrest and war;/business and industrial/war industry;/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/family and parenting/children;/business and industrial/business operations/management/business process;/health and fitness;/law, govt and politics/politics;/business and industrial/war industry/weaponry;/technology and computing/internet technology
547	SANDERS	Now, I voted against this gun liability law because I was concerned that in rural areas all over this country, if a gun shop owner sells a weapon legally to somebody, and that person then goes out and kills somebody, I don't believe it is appropriate that that gun shop owner who just sold a legal weapon to be held accountable and be sued.	/law, govt and politics;/society/crime/personal offense;/society/crime/property crime;/society/crime/personal offense/homicide;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/law, govt and politics/law enforcement;/society/social institution/divorce;/business and industrial/war industry/weaponry;/family and parenting/children;/society/crime/property crime/fraud
548	SANDERS	But, what I do believe is when gun shop owners and others knowingly are selling weapons to people who should not have them -- somebody walks in.	/business and industrial/war industry/weaponry;/sports/hunting and shooting;/law, govt and politics;/sports/walking;/sports/baseball;/sports/fencing;/society/crime/personal offense;/sports/hunting and shooting/target shooting;/society/crime/personal offense/homicide

550	BLITZER	So, Senator, do you owe the Sandy Hook families an apology?	/law, govt and politics/government;/family and parenting;/society/welfare/healthcare;/family and parenting/children
551	SANDERS	No, I don't think I owe them an apology.	/society/racism;/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/immigration;/law, govt and politics/government;/health and fitness/incest and abuse support;/art and entertainment/movies;/society/gay life;/family and parenting/children;/law, govt and politics/government/heads of state;/business and industrial/business news

554	CLINTON	Well, I believe that the law that Senator Sanders voted for that I voted against, giving this special protection to gun manufacturers and to dealers, is an absolute abdication of responsibility on the part of those who voted for it.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections;/automotive and vehicles
555	CLINTON	This is a -- this is a unique gift given to only one industry in the world by the United States Congress, as Senator Murphy from Connecticut said, we have tougher standards holding toy gun manufacturers and sellers to account than we do for real guns.	/shopping/toys
556	CLINTON	And the point that Senator Sanders keeps making about how he wouldn't want a mom and pop store -- that was not the point of this.	/shopping/retail/outlet stores

564	SANDERS	Let me just reiterate -- just reiterate so there is no confusion, decades ago, before it was popular, in a rural state with no gun control, Bernie Sanders said, let's ban assault weapons, not see them distributed in the United States of America.	/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections;/society/crime/personal offense/hate crime;/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/law enforcement;/law, govt and politics/politics/lobbying;/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/society/crime/personal offense/assault;/society/sex;/society/gay life

566	BLITZER	Let's turn it over to Errol Lewis, of New York 1 Time Warner Cable News.	/news;/news/national news;/business and industrial/business news;/sports/sports news
567	LOUIS	Secretary Clinton, the 1994 crime bill that you supported added 100,000 police officers across the country and banned certain assault weapons.	/society/crime
568	LOUIS	It also imposed tougher prison sentences and eliminated federal funding for inmate education.	/education/special education;/finance/grants, scholarships and financial aid/government grants
569	LOUIS	Looking at the bill as a whole, do you believe it was a net positive or do you think it was a mistake?	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/parliament;/society/sex;/family and parenting;/family and parenting/children;/law, govt and politics/government/legislative;/business and industrial/energy;/religion and spirituality;/business and industrial/green solutions;/law, govt and politics/politics
570	CLINTON	Well, I think that it had some positive aspects to it.	/education/homework and study tips;/religion and spirituality;/health and fitness/sexuality;/family and parenting/children;/education/teaching and classroom resources;/society/sex;/business and industrial/advertising and marketing;/law, govt and politics/politics;/family and parenting/parenting teens
571	CLINTON	And you mentioned some of them.	/society/dating;/religion and spirituality/hinduism;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/travel/traveling with kids;/religion and spirituality/christianity;/pets/large animals
572	CLINTON	The Violence Against Women Act, which has been a very important piece of legislation, in my opinion.	/law, govt and politics/government;/society/crime/sexual offence/rape;/society/sex;/law, govt and politics/government/legislative;/health and fitness/women's health;/law, govt and politics/government/parliament;/society/sex/pornography;/society/crime/sexual offence/prostitution;/society/crime/personal offense;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary

574	CLINTON	And it also did some things which were to provide more opportunities for young people.	/education/homework and study tips;/education/studying business;/education/teaching and classroom resources;/family and parenting/children;/business and industrial/business operations/human resources/compensation and benefits;/technology and computing/internet technology;/careers/career planning;/business and industrial/business operations/management/business process;/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/society/sex
575	CLINTON	So if we were to have the balance sheet on one side, there are some positive actions and changes.	/finance/financial news;/finance/bank;/finance/accounting and auditing;/business and industrial/company/earnings;/finance/investing;/finance/investing/beginning investing;/real estate/buying and selling homes;/finance/investing/funds;/business and industrial/business operations;/law, govt and politics

578	CLINTON	The original idea was not that we would increase sentences for non-violent low-level offenders, but once the federal government did what it did, states piled on.	/society/crime;/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/law enforcement;/society/crime/personal offense;/education/special education
579	CLINTON	So we have a problem.	/business and industrial/business software;/science/computer science/artificial intelligence;/science/computer science/cryptography
580	CLINTON	And the very first speech I gave in this campaign was about what I will do to reform the criminal justice system and end the over-mass incarceration.	/society/crime;/law, govt and politics
581	CLINTON	So I think that if all of us go and look back at where we were, Senator Sanders voted for the crime bill, and he says the same thing, there were some good things, and things that we have to change and learn from.	/society/crime
582	CLINTON	So that's how I see it.	/family and parenting/children;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/religion and spirituality/christianity/orthodoxy;/family and parenting/babies and toddlers/baby clothes;/society;/society/dating;/style and fashion/body art;/society/sex;/society/senior living;/law, govt and politics/politics
583	CLINTON	And I think we ought to be putting our attention on forging a consensus to make the changes that will divert more people from the criminal justice system to start.	/society/crime;/law, govt and politics
584	LOUIS	Thank you, Secretary.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/politics;/law, govt and politics/government/executive branch;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections;/law, govt and politics/politics/domestic policy;/law, govt and politics/politics/foreign policy;/law, govt and politics/government/state and local government;/finance;/society/work
585	CLINTON	To tackle systemic racism and divert people in the beginning.	/society/racism

590	CLINTON	My husband has apologized.	/society/social institution/divorce;/society/social institution/marriage;/family and parenting/children

595	CLINTON	I've seen the results of what has happened in families and in communities.	/family and parenting;/family and parenting/children

602	LOUIS	Senator Sanders, earlier this week at the Apollo Theater in Harlem, you called out President Clinton for defending Secretary Clinton's use of the term super-predator back in the '90s when she supported the crime bill.	/society/crime;/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections

659	BLITZER	Let's turn to another critically important issue.	/art and entertainment/comics and animation/comics;/art and entertainment/shows and events
660	BLITZER	Senator, Secretary, the issue of energy and the environment.	/law, govt and politics/government
661	BLITZER	Secretary Clinton, Senator Sanders has said you are in the pocket of the fossil fuel industry.	/business and industrial/energy/renewable energy;/law, govt and politics/government;/business and industrial/energy/electricity;/business and industrial/energy/renewable energy/biofuel;/business and industrial/energy/natural gas;/business and industrial/energy/nuclear power;/business and industrial/green solutions;/business and industrial/energy/renewable energy/wind energy;/business and industrial/energy/renewable energy/geothermal energy

664	CLINTON	Well, let me start by saying we need to talk about this issue and we should talk about it in terms of the extraordinary threats that climate change pose to our country and our world.	/business and industrial/energy/renewable energy;/law, govt and politics;/business and industrial/green solutions;/business and industrial/energy/nuclear power;/society
665	CLINTON	And that's why for the last many years, both in the Senate and as secretary of State, it's been a big part of my commitment to see what could be done.	/law, govt and politics/government
666	CLINTON	But there has never been any doubt that when I was a senator, I tried -- I joined with others to try to get rid of the subsidies for big oil.	/business and industrial/energy/oil
667	CLINTON	And I have proposed that again, because that's what I think needs to be done as we transition from fossil fuels to clean energy.	/science/ecology/pollution;/science/ecology/environmental disaster;/automotive and vehicles/electric vehicles;/finance/investing;/finance/investing/beginning investing
668	CLINTON	And everyone who's looked at this independently, "The Washington Post" and others, who give us both hard times when called for on facts, have said that this is absolutely an incorrect false charge.	/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/society/crime/sexual offence;/society/crime/personal offense;/law, govt and politics/government;/society/crime/personal offense/torture;/business and industrial/business news;/law, govt and politics/government/executive branch;/news/national news;/society/crime/property crime/fraud
669	CLINTON	So, we both have relatively small amounts of contributions from people who work for fossil fuel companies.	/business and industrial/energy/renewable energy;/business and industrial/energy/electricity;/business and industrial/energy/natural gas;/business and industrial/green solutions;/business and industrial/energy/renewable energy/biofuel;/business and industrial/energy/nuclear power;/finance/investing;/finance/investing/beginning investing;/business and industrial/energy/renewable energy/solar energy
670	CLINTON	Best we can tell from the reports that are done.	/news
671	CLINTON	But, that is not being supported by big oil, and I think it's important to distinguish that.	/business and industrial/energy/oil
672	CLINTON	And, let's talk about what each of us has proposed to try to combat greenhouse gas emissions and put us on the fastest track possible to clean energy.	/business and industrial/energy/renewable energy;/business and industrial/energy/renewable energy/biofuel;/business and industrial/energy/electricity;/business and industrial/green solutions;/business and industrial/energy/natural gas;/automotive and vehicles/cars/hybrid
673	BLITZER	Thank you.	
674	BLITZER	We're going to get to that to, but I want you to respond, Senator.	/law, govt and politics/government
675	SANDERS	It is one thing, as the Secretary indicated, to talk about workers.	/society/work;/society/work/unions
676	SANDERS	I'm sure I have contributions, you have contributions from workers in every industry in the country.	/business and industrial/paper industry;/business and industrial/war industry;/society/work
677	SANDERS	But, as I understand it, 43 lobbyists for the fossil fuel industry maxed out, gave the maximum amount of money to Secretary Clinton's campaign.	/business and industrial/energy/renewable energy;/business and industrial/energy/electricity;/business and industrial/energy/natural gas;/business and industrial/energy/renewable energy/biofuel;/business and industrial/green solutions;/business and industrial/energy/nuclear power;/business and industrial/paper industry;/business and industrial/energy/renewable energy/wind energy;/business and industrial/war industry

696	CLINTON	Well, let's talk about the global environmental crisis.	/science/ecology/environmental disaster
697	CLINTON	Starting in 2009 as your Secretary of State, I worked with President Obama to bring China and India to the table for the very first time, to get a commitment out of them that they would begin to address their own greenhouse gas emissions.	/business and industrial/energy/renewable energy;/business and industrial/energy/renewable energy/biofuel;/business and industrial/energy/electricity;/business and industrial/green solutions;/business and industrial/energy/natural gas;/business and industrial/energy/nuclear power

722	CLINTON	Well, I'm a little bewildered about how to respond when you have an agreement which gives you the framework to actually take the action that would have only come about because under the Obama administration in the face of implacable hostility from the Republicans in Congress, President Obama moved forward on gas mileage, he moved forward on the clean power plant.	/business and industrial/energy/nuclear power;/business and industrial/energy/natural gas;/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/armed forces

739	LOUIS	Fracking, of course, a way of extracting natural gas.	/business and industrial/energy/natural gas
740	LOUIS	Now as a candidate for president, you say that by the time you're done with all your rules and regulations, fracking will be restricted in many places around the country.	/business and industrial/energy/natural gas;/business and industrial/energy/oil/oil and gas prices
741	LOUIS	Why have you changed your view on fracking?	/business and industrial/energy/natural gas;/business and industrial/energy/oil/oil and gas prices
742	CLINTON	No, well, I don't think I've changed my view on what we need to do to go from where we are, where the world is heavily dependent on coal and oil, but principally coal, to where we need to be, which is clean renewable energy, and one of the bridge fuels is natural gas.	/business and industrial/energy/natural gas;/business and industrial/energy/renewable energy;/business and industrial/energy/coal
743	CLINTON	And so for both economic and environmental and strategic reasons, it was American policy to try to help countries get out from under the constant use of coal, building coal plants all the time, also to get out from under, especially if they were in Europe, the pressure from Russia, which has been incredibly intense.	/business and industrial/energy/coal
744	CLINTON	So we did say natural gas is a bridge.	/business and industrial/energy/natural gas
745	CLINTON	We want to cross that bridge as quickly as possible, because in order to deal with climate change, we have got to move as rapidly as we can.	/business and industrial/energy/renewable energy;/business and industrial/green solutions;/business and industrial/construction

749	CLINTON	So I have big, bold goals, but I know in order to get from where we are, where the world is still burning way too much coal, where the world is still too intimidated by countries and providers like Russia, we have got to make a very firm but decisive move in the direction of clean energy.	/business and industrial/energy/coal

884	CLINTON	There was also in that a reference to the Security Council, and I know you're not shy when you oppose something, Senator.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/politics/foreign policy;/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections;/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/government/legislative
885	CLINTON	So, yes, it was unanimous.	/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/referendums;/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/legislative
886	CLINTON	That's exactly right, including you.	/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/law, govt and politics/politics;/society/unrest and war;/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/family and parenting/children
887	CLINTON	And what we did was to try to provide support for our European and Arab allies and partners.	/society/unrest and war;/education/teaching and classroom resources/school supplies
888	CLINTON	The decision was the president's.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/heads of state;/law, govt and politics/government/parliament;/law, govt and politics/government/executive branch;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections
889	CLINTON	Did I do the due diligence?	/finance/investing;/finance/investing/beginning investing;/finance/investing/funds/hedge fund;/finance/financial news;/finance/investing/venture capital
890	CLINTON	Did I talk to everybody I could talk to?	/art and entertainment/radio/talk radio

892	CLINTON	Yes, I did.

894	CLINTON	But at the end of the day, those are the decisions that are made by the president to in any way use American military power.	/law, govt and politics/government;/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/government/parliament;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary;/law, govt and politics/government/heads of state;/law, govt and politics/government/executive branch;/law, govt and politics/politics;/law, govt and politics/armed forces

896	CLINTON	And, yes, we did try without success because of the Libyans' obstruction to our efforts, but we did try and we will continue to try to help the Libyan people.	/sports/rugby;/law, govt and politics/government/embassies and consulates;/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/politics;/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement

898	BLITZER	Go ahead, Senator.	
899	SANDERS	If you listen, you know -- two points.	/art and entertainment/music/music genres/world music;/art and entertainment/music/music reference;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/art and entertainment/radio;/sports/go kart;/art and entertainment/music/singing;/art and entertainment/music/music genres/religious music;/art and entertainment/shows and events/classical concert;/art and entertainment/music/recording industry;/family and parenting/children
900	SANDERS	Number one, yes, 100-0 in the Senate voted for democracy in Libya and I would vote for that again.	/law, govt and politics/politics;/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/politics/political parties;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/referendums;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections;/law, govt and politics/government/parliament;/society/welfare/healthcare
901	SANDERS	But that is very different from getting actively involved to overthrow and bring about regime change without fully understanding what the consequence of that regime change would be.	/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/politics;/law, govt and politics/politics/foreign policy;/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/education/homework and study tips;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/law, govt and politics/government/heads of state;/business and industrial/business operations
902	SANDERS	Second of all, I know you keep referring to Barack Obama all night here, but you in Syria, you in Syria talked about a no-fly zone, which the president certainly does not support, nor do I support because, A, it will cost an enormous sum of money, second of all, it runs the risk of getting us sucked into perpetual warfare in that region.	/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/business and industrial/business operations;/law, govt and politics/armed forces/air force;/law, govt and politics/politics/foreign policy
903	SANDERS	Thirdly, when we talk about Syria right now, no debate, like Gadhafi, like Saddam Hussein, Assad is another brutal murdering dictator, but right now our fight is to destroy ISIS first, and to get rid of Assad second.	/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/society/unrest and war;/religion and spirituality/islam;/law, govt and politics/government/heads of state;/law, govt and politics/politics/foreign policy;/business and industrial/war industry/weaponry;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement
904	CLINTON	Well, I think Senator Sanders has just reinforced my point.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections
905	CLINTON	Yes, when I was secretary of state I did urge, along with the Department of Defense and the CIA that we seek out, vet, and train, and arm Syrian opposition figures so that they could defend themselves against Assad.	/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/law, govt and politics/espionage and intelligence/terrorism
906	CLINTON	The president said no.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/heads of state;/law, govt and politics/government/parliament;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections;/law, govt and politics/government/executive branch;/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary
907	CLINTON	Now, that's how it works.	/art and entertainment/visual art and design/painting;/art and entertainment/books and literature;/art and entertainment/music/music reference;/art and entertainment/visual art and design/art and craft supplies;/style and fashion/body art;/careers/telecommuting;/art and entertainment/shows and events/classical concert;/art and entertainment/books and literature/poetry;/art and entertainment/shows and events/exhibition;/art and entertainment/visual art and design/sculpture
908	CLINTON	People who work for the president make recommendations and then the president makes the decision.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/heads of state;/law, govt and politics/government/parliament;/law, govt and politics/government/executive branch;/society/unrest and war
909	CLINTON	So I think it's only fair to look at where we are in Syria today.	/society/unrest and war;/style and fashion;/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/religion and spirituality/islam;/religion and spirituality/christianity;/religion and spirituality/judaism;/business and industrial/war industry;/style and fashion/clothing;/business and industrial/war industry/weaponry;/style and fashion/clothing/skirts
910	CLINTON	And, yes, I do still support a no-fly zone because I think we need to put in safe havens for those poor Syrians who are fleeing both Assad and ISIS and have some place that they can be safe.	/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/armed forces/air force
911	BLITZER	Staying on national security, Dana Bash has a question.	/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/law, govt and politics/politics/foreign policy;/law, govt and politics/espionage and intelligence/terrorism;/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/executive branch;/law, govt and politics/espionage and intelligence/surveillance;/law, govt and politics/government/heads of state
912	BASH	Senator Sanders, in 1997, you said this about NATO, you said, quote: "It is not the time to continue wasting tens of billions of dollars helping to defend Europe, let alone assuming more than our share of any cost associated with expanding NATO."	/law, govt and politics/government;/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections;/business and industrial/business operations;/law, govt and politics/politics/foreign policy;/law, govt and politics/government/heads of state;/finance/bank;/society/work/unemployment

914	SANDERS	Well, what I believe, if my memory is correct here, we spend about 75 percent of the entire cost of the military aspect of NATO.	/technology and computing/hardware/computer components/memory
915	SANDERS	Given the fact that France has a very good health care system and free public education, college education for their people, the U.K. has a good National Health Service and they also provide fairly reasonable higher education, you know what, yeah, I do believe that the countries of Europe should pick up more of the burden for their defense.	/education;/education/studying business;/health and fitness/men's health;/health and fitness/dental care
916	SANDERS	Yes, I do.

918	BASH	And just following up, Senator Sanders, Donald Trump also argues that NATO is unfair economically to the U.S. because America pays a disproportionate share.	/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections;/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/politics/foreign policy;/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/society/work/unemployment;/law, govt and politics/immigration;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement

921	SANDERS	All I can tell you is, with a huge deficit, with 47 million people living in poverty, with our inner cities collapsing, yeah, I do think countries like Germany and U.K. and France and European countries whose economy, or at least its standard of living and health care and education, they're doing pretty well.	/society/work/unemployment;/health and fitness/men's health;/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/politics;/law, govt and politics/government
922	SANDERS	So I would not be embarrassed as president of the United States to stay to our European allies, you know what, the United States of America cannot just support your economies.	/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/politics;/society/work/unemployment;/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/politics/foreign policy;/law, govt and politics/immigration;/law, govt and politics/government/heads of state

926	BASH	Secretary Clinton?	/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections
927	CLINTON	I support our continuing involvement in NATO.	/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics;/business and industrial/business operations;/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/law, govt and politics/politics/foreign policy;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/law, govt and politics/armed forces/air force;/law, govt and politics/government/heads of state
928	CLINTON	And it is important to ask for our NATO allies to pay more of the cost.	/law, govt and politics;/society/unrest and war;/society/work;/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/finance/financial news;/business and industrial/war industry;/finance/investing/funds;/society/work/unemployment;/business and industrial/energy/electricity

932	CLINTON	It has bound together across the Atlantic countries that are democracies, that have many of the same values and interests, and now we need to modernize it and move it into the 21st century to serve as that head of our defense operations in Europe when it comes to terrorism and other threats that we face.	/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/politics;/business and industrial/business operations;/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/politics/foreign policy;/law, govt and politics/law enforcement
933	CLINTON	So...	
934	BASH	But, Madam Secretary... CLINTON: ... yes, of course they should be paying more, but that doesn't mean if they don't we leave, because I don't think that's in America's interests.	/law, govt and politics/politics/foreign policy;/law, govt and politics/government;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/finance/financial news;/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/society;/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/politics/lobbying;/education/studying business;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement
935	BASH	That's going to be part of my -- my question to you is, to that point, there are 28 countries in the alliance, and the United States gives more money to NATO's budget than 21 of those countries combined.	/law, govt and politics;/society/unrest and war;/education/special education;/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/finance/grants, scholarships and financial aid/government grants;/law, govt and politics/politics;/society/work/unemployment;/law, govt and politics/politics/foreign policy;/business and industrial/business operations;/education/teaching and classroom resources

944	CLINTON	With Russia being more aggressive, making all kinds of intimidating moves toward the Baltic countries, we've seen what they've done in Eastern Ukraine, we know how they want to rewrite the map of Europe, it is not in our interests.	/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/politics;/science/geography/cartography;/law, govt and politics/politics/foreign policy

952	SANDERS	Well, as somebody who spent many months of my life when I was a kid in Israel, who has family in Israel, of course Israel has a right not only to defend themselves, but to live in peace and security without fear of terrorist attack.	/religion and spirituality/judaism

110	MR.

111	MR.

112	MR. SCHWAB	And my first question is, why is the tax reform — why has it been of such a high priority for your administration?	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/politics/domestic policy;/society/work/unemployment;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/law, govt and politics/government/legislative;/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/government/executive branch;/law, govt and politics/politics/lobbying
113	TRUMP	Well, first of all, Klaus, I want to congratulate you.	/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/society/unrest and war;/family and parenting/children;/law, govt and politics;/sports/go kart;/law, govt and politics/politics;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/society/dating;/family and parenting/parenting teens;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections
114	TRUMP	This is an incredible group of people.	/art and entertainment/comics and animation/comics;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/art and entertainment/comics and animation/anime and manga;/art and entertainment/shows and events/concert;/society/racism;/family and parenting/parenting teens;/art and entertainment/movies;/style and fashion/body art;/society/senior living;/family and parenting/children
115	TRUMP	We had dinner last night with about 15 leaders of industry, none of whom I knew, but all of whom I’ve read about for years.	/business and industrial/war industry;/business and industrial/paper industry
116	TRUMP	And it was truly an incredible group.	/art and entertainment/shows and events/concert;/art and entertainment/movies and tv/movies/reviews;/art and entertainment/comics and animation/anime and manga;/art and entertainment/movies and tv/action;/society/senior living;/style and fashion/body art;/art and entertainment/shows and events/classical concert;/family and parenting;/sports/fencing;/art and entertainment/comics and animation/comics
117	TRUMP	But I think I have 15 new friends.	/family and parenting/parenting teens;/society/dating;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/hobbies and interests/home recording;/society/teens;/family and parenting/babies and toddlers/baby clothes;/hobbies and interests/magic and illusion;/hobbies and interests/getting published;/style and fashion/body art;/family and parenting/children
118	TRUMP	So this has been really great what you’ve done and putting it together, the economic forum.	/family and parenting/babies and toddlers/baby clothes;/society/dating;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/society/unrest and war;/health and fitness/sexuality;/family and parenting/parenting teens;/law, govt and politics/politics;/style and fashion;/family and parenting/children;/society/teens
119	TRUMP	The tax reform was a dream of a lot of people over many years, but they weren’t able to get it done.	/law, govt and politics/government;/society/work/unemployment;/real estate/buying and selling homes;/finance/financial news;/finance/bank;/business and industrial;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/law, govt and politics/government/legislative
120	TRUMP	Many people tried, and Ronald Reagan was really the last to make a meaningful cut and reform.	/law, govt and politics/politics;/society/welfare/healthcare;/society/work/unemployment;/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/government;/education/teaching and classroom resources;/law, govt and politics/politics/foreign policy;/law, govt and politics/politics/domestic policy;/law, govt and politics/politics/political parties;/law, govt and politics/armed forces
121	TRUMP	And ours is cutting and reforming.	/society/welfare/healthcare;/sports/fencing;/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/politics;/society/work/unemployment;/education/teaching and classroom resources/school supplies;/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/law, govt and politics/government/parliament;/law, govt and politics/politics/political parties
122	TRUMP	We emphasize cut, but the reform is probably almost as important.	/law, govt and politics/politics;/society/unrest and war;/society/work/unemployment;/style and fashion;/education/teaching and classroom resources;/education/teaching and classroom resources/school supplies;/society/dating;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/business and industrial/metals;/religion and spirituality/judaism
123	TRUMP	We’ve wanted to do it.	/society/unrest and war;/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/politics
124	TRUMP	It is very tough, politically, to do it.	/law, govt and politics/politics;/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/government
125	TRUMP	Hard to believe that would be, but it is very, very tough.	/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/government;/art and entertainment/movies;/society/crime/personal offense;/society/crime/personal offense/assault;/family and parenting/parenting teens;/society/senior living;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/society/teens
126	TRUMP	That’s why it hasn’t been done in close to 40 years.	/family and parenting/children;/business and industrial/business operations/management/business process;/education/studying business;/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/education/homework and study tips;/education/teaching and classroom resources/school supplies;/law, govt and politics;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/society/senior living;/society/work
127	TRUMP	And once we got it going, it was going.	/sports/go kart;/society/dating;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/family and parenting/babies and toddlers/baby clothes;/family and parenting/parenting teens;/automotive and vehicles/auto parts;/sports/walking;/society/teens;/sports/bowling
128	TRUMP	And the big — and I wouldn’t say a total surprise, but one of the big things that happened and took place is AT&T and some others came out very early and they said they were going to pay thousands and thousands of dollars to people that work for their companies.	/finance/investing/funds;/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/law, govt and politics;/business and industrial/company/earnings;/finance/financial news;/society/unrest and war;/finance/investing/day trading;/finance/investing/beginning investing;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/finance/grants, scholarships and financial aid
129	TRUMP	And you have 300,000, 400,000, 500,000 people working for these companies, and all of a sudden it became like a big waterfall, a big, beautiful waterfall where so many companies are doing it.	/business and industrial/company;/finance/investing;/finance/investing/beginning investing;/business and industrial/company/earnings;/finance/financial news;/business and industrial/war industry;/business and industrial/business operations;/business and industrial/manufacturing;/business and industrial/paper industry;/business and industrial/business operations/management/business process
130	TRUMP	And even today they just announced many more.	/law, govt and politics;/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/politics;/business and industrial/company;/business and industrial/company/merger and acquisition;/law, govt and politics/immigration;/religion and spirituality/judaism;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/automotive and vehicles/auto parts;/religion and spirituality/christianity
131	TRUMP	But every day they announce more and more.	/sports/wrestling;/shopping;/law, govt and politics/government;/shopping/resources/contests and freebies;/travel/traveling with kids;/news;/automotive and vehicles/road-side assistance;/food and drink;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/food and drink/cuisines
132	TRUMP	And now it’s a fight for who’s going to give the most.	/sports/boxing
133	TRUMP	It started at 1,000, and now we have them up to 3,000.	/society/unrest and war;/business and industrial/business operations;/automotive and vehicles/auto parts;/sports/cricket;/automotive and vehicles/cars/car culture;/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/business and industrial/war industry;/automotive and vehicles/cars/hybrid
134	TRUMP	This is something that we didn’t anticipate.	/art and entertainment/shows and events;/style and fashion/body art;/family and parenting/children;/society;/family and parenting/parenting teens;/health and fitness/sexuality;/law, govt and politics;/society/sex;/society/teens;/art and entertainment/movies
135	TRUMP	Oftentimes in business, things happen that you don’t anticipate.	/business and industrial;/business and industrial/business operations/management/business process;/business and industrial/business news;/finance/financial news
136	TRUMP	Usually that’s a bad thing, but this was a good thing.	/food and drink/food;/society;/style and fashion;/society/social institution;/society/social institution/marriage;/family and parenting/children;/society/social institution/divorce;/art and entertainment;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/style and fashion/body art
137	TRUMP	This came out of nowhere.	/automotive and vehicles/cars/coupe;/society/unrest and war;/automotive and vehicles/cars/sedan;/automotive and vehicles/cars/car culture;/automotive and vehicles/cars/convertible;/automotive and vehicles/cars/wagon;/automotive and vehicles/auto parts;/sports/cricket;/automotive and vehicles/cars/performance vehicles;/law, govt and politics/politics
138	TRUMP	Nobody ever thought of this as a possibility even.	/law, govt and politics/politics;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/society/unrest and war;/family and parenting/children;/society/senior living;/religion and spirituality;/religion and spirituality/christianity;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/family and parenting/parenting teens;/style and fashion/body art
139	TRUMP	It wasn’t in the equation.	/business and industrial/business software;/science/physics/electromagnetism;/science/physics/thermodynamics;/business and industrial/energy;/science/mathematics/geometry
140	TRUMP	We waited — we said, wait until February 1st when the checks start coming in.	/business and industrial/business operations;/law, govt and politics;/finance/bank/bank account;/travel/transports/sea travel;/finance/bank/checks;/society/unrest and war;/travel/business travel;/news;/travel/transports/train travel;/finance/financial news
141	TRUMP	And people, Klaus, have a lot more money in their paycheck — because it’s not just a little money, this is a lot of money for people making a living doing whatever they may be doing.	/finance/bank/bank account;/finance/investing/funds;/finance/financial news;/finance/bank/checks;/finance/investing/beginning investing;/business and industrial;/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/society/work;/society/work/unemployment;/family and parenting
142	TRUMP	And we really though February 1st it was going to kick in and everybody was going to be — well, we haven’t even gotten there yet and it’s kicked in.	/art and entertainment/shows and events;/sports/go kart;/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/sports/football;/travel/traveling with kids;/society/dating;/society/senior living;/style and fashion/body art;/family and parenting/parenting teens;/family and parenting/children
143	TRUMP	And it’s had an incredible impact on the stock market and the stock prices.	/finance/investing/stocks;/finance/investing/beginning investing;/finance/investing/day trading;/finance/investing/funds/mutual funds
144	TRUMP	We’ve set 84 records since my election — record stock market prices, meaning we hit new highs 84 different times out of a one-year period.	/finance/investing/stocks;/finance/investing/day trading;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections;/real estate/buying and selling homes;/finance/investing/beginning investing;/society/work/unemployment;/finance/financial news;/finance/bank;/finance/investing/funds/mutual funds;/law, govt and politics/politics/political parties

146	TRUMP	And in all fairness, that was done before we passed the tax cuts and tax reform.	/society/welfare/healthcare
147	TRUMP	So what happened is really something special.	/art and entertainment/shows and events;/art and entertainment/movies and tv/movies;/family and parenting/parenting teens;/art and entertainment/movies and tv/movies/reviews;/family and parenting/babies and toddlers/baby clothes;/style and fashion/body art;/society;/society/dating;/society/teens;/family and parenting/children
148	TRUMP	Then, as you know, and as I just said, Apple came in with $350 billion.	/technology and computing/operating systems/mac os;/finance/investing;/finance/investing/beginning investing;/technology and computing/hardware/computer components/disks
149	TRUMP	And I tell you, I spoke with Tim Cook; I said, Tim, I will never consider this whole great run that we’ve made complete until you start building plants in the U.S.	/sports/go kart;/law, govt and politics;/society/senior living;/food and drink;/society/unrest and war;/family and parenting/children;/business and industrial/green solutions;/food and drink/cuisines;/business and industrial/energy/electricity;/art and entertainment/shows and events

151	TRUMP	But when I heard 350, I thought he was talking — I thought they were talking $350 million.	/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/family and parenting/children;/law, govt and politics/politics;/society;/business and industrial/company/earnings;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/society/dating;/family and parenting/babies and toddlers;/family and parenting/parenting teens;/business and industrial/company/merger and acquisition
152	TRUMP	And, by the way, that’s a nice-sized plant.	/business and industrial/energy/nuclear power;/business and industrial/energy/nuclear power/nuclear accident;/business and industrial/energy/natural gas;/business and industrial/manufacturing;/business and industrial/energy/coal
153	TRUMP	Not the greatest, but not bad.	/art and entertainment/movies and tv/movies/reviews;/art and entertainment/movies and tv/action;/careers/career planning;/careers/job fairs;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/sports/tennis;/society/unrest and war;/art and entertainment/shows and events/classical concert
154	TRUMP	And they said, “No, sir.

156	TRUMP	Well, we have tremendous amounts of money, including my newfound friends from last night — great companies.	/business and industrial/company;/finance/investing;/finance/investing/beginning investing;/finance/financial news;/business and industrial/company/earnings;/business and industrial/business operations;/business and industrial/business operations/management/business process;/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/business and industrial/war industry;/business and industrial/business news
157	TRUMP	They’re all investing.	/finance/investing;/finance/investing/beginning investing
158	TRUMP	When one of the gentlemen said he’s putting in $2 billion because of the tax cuts, I said to myself, “Wow, he’s actually the cheap one in the group” — because they’re putting in massive numbers of billions of dollars.	/finance/investing;/finance/investing/beginning investing;/society/work/unemployment;/finance/bank;/finance/financial news;/finance/investing/funds;/business and industrial/company/earnings;/real estate/buying and selling homes;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/business and industrial/war industry

160	TRUMP	You have a United States where people from all over the world are looking to come in and invest, and there’s just nothing like what’s happening.	/finance/investing;/finance/investing/beginning investing
161	TRUMP	And I just want to finish by — I have a group of people that have been so — I have a whole lot of them, so I won’t introduce because then I’ll insult at least half of them.	/automotive and vehicles/auto parts;/sports/auto racing/nascar;/automotive and vehicles/cars/car culture;/sports/boat racing;/sports/go kart;/automotive and vehicles/buying and selling cars;/automotive and vehicles/cars/performance vehicles;/society;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/sports/olympics
162	TRUMP	But I’ve had a group of people that worked so hard on this and other things.	/society/social institution/divorce;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/family and parenting/babies and toddlers/baby clothes;/family and parenting/children;/art and entertainment/shows and events/concert;/style and fashion;/style and fashion/body art;/law, govt and politics/politics;/religion and spirituality

165	TRUMP	When you look at all of the different charts and polls, and you see, as an example, African American unemployment at the historic low — it’s never had a period of time like this.	/society/work/unemployment;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections
166	TRUMP	Same with Hispanic.	/law, govt and politics/immigration;/society/crime/personal offense/hate crime;/society/racism

197	TRUMP	I’d buy things that would fail –that would be failures — and I’d turn them around and try and get them for the right price, and then I’d turn them around and make them successful.	/automotive and vehicles/buying and selling cars;/finance/investing/day trading;/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/finance/financial news;/automotive and vehicles/auto parts

94	CLINTON	Of course, we are 5 percent of the world's population; we have to trade with the other 95 percent.	/education/special education;/business and industrial/manufacturing;/finance/grants, scholarships and financial aid/government grants;/society/work/unemployment;/finance/investing/day trading;/finance/investing/funds;/business and industrial/war industry;/finance/investing/beginning investing;/business and industrial/paper industry;/education/high school

100	CLINTON	That is not how we grow the economy.	/society/work/unemployment;/business and industrial/agriculture and forestry/agriculture

485	CLINTON	For 40 years, everyone running for president has released their tax returns.	/law, govt and politics/government;/real estate/buying and selling homes;/business and industrial;/education/studying business;/society/work;/society/work/retirement;/society/dating;/travel/traveling with kids;/society/work/unemployment;/travel/business travel
486	CLINTON	You can go and see nearly, I think, 39, 40 years of our tax returns, but everyone has done it.	/real estate/buying and selling homes;/family and parenting/babies and toddlers/baby clothes;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/family and parenting/children;/society;/society/dating;/family and parenting/parenting teens;/law, govt and politics;/business and industrial;/law, govt and politics/government
487	CLINTON	We know the IRS has made clear there is no prohibition on releasing it when you're under audit.	/finance/accounting and auditing/tax preparation and planning;/finance/investing/funds
488	CLINTON	So you've got to ask yourself, why won't he release his tax returns?	/real estate/buying and selling homes;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/business and industrial;/business and industrial/record company;/law, govt and politics/government;/art and entertainment/shows and events/concert;/business and industrial/business software;/travel/traveling with kids;/family and parenting;/business and industrial/business news
489	CLINTON	And I think there may be a couple of reasons.	/society/social institution;/society/social institution/marriage;/society/social institution/divorce;/family and parenting/children;/society/social institution/marriage/common law marriage;/society/social institution/marriage/weddings;/law, govt and politics;/health and fitness/sexuality;/society/sex
490	CLINTON	First, maybe he's not as rich as he says he is.	/family and parenting/babies and toddlers/baby clothes;/society/dating;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/food and drink;/style and fashion;/style and fashion/body art;/society/sex;/family and parenting/parenting teens;/society/senior living;/law, govt and politics/politics
491	CLINTON	Second, maybe he's not as charitable as he claims to be.	/law, govt and politics;/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/society;/business and industrial/company/earnings;/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/politics/lobbying;/society/welfare;/health and fitness;/business and industrial/company/bankruptcy
492	CLINTON	Third, we don't know all of his business dealings, but we have been told through investigative reporting that he owes about $650 million to Wall Street and foreign banks.	/finance/bank;/finance/financial news
493	CLINTON	Or maybe he doesn't want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes, because the only years that anybody's ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license, and they showed he didn't pay any federal income tax.	/finance/investing/funds;/finance/grants, scholarships and financial aid/government grants;/society/welfare/healthcare;/business and industrial/company/earnings;/real estate/buying and selling homes;/society/work;/society/work/unemployment;/law, govt and politics/government;/finance/financial news

495	CLINTON	So if he's paid zero, that means zero for troops, zero for vets, zero for schools or health.	/health and fitness/men's health
496	CLINTON	And I think probably he's not all that enthusiastic about having the rest of our country see what the real reasons are, because it must be something really important, even terrible, that he's trying to hide.	/art and entertainment/shows and events;/society/dating;/family and parenting/children;/law, govt and politics;/society/unrest and war;/family and parenting/babies and toddlers/baby clothes;/law, govt and politics/politics;/family and parenting/parenting teens;/style and fashion/body art;/society/senior living

605	TRUMP	When we look at the budget, the budget is bad to a large extent because we have people that have no idea as to what to do and how to buy.	/finance/investing/funds;/finance/grants, scholarships and financial aid/government grants;/science/mathematics/algebra;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement

611	HOLT	The share of Americans who say race relations are bad in this country is the highest it's been in decades, much of it amplified by shootings of African-Americans by police, as we've seen recently in Charlotte and Tulsa.	/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/law enforcement;/society/racism;/law, govt and politics/immigration;/society/unrest and war;/society/crime/personal offense/hate crime

617	CLINTON	Unfortunately, race still determines too much, often determines where people live, determines what kind of education in their public schools they can get, and, yes, it determines how they're treated in the criminal justice system.	/society/crime;/education/special education;/education/high school;/law, govt and politics;/education/school;/education/school/private school;/education/homework and study tips

620	CLINTON	We have to restore trust between communities and the police.	/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/law enforcement;/law, govt and politics/law enforcement/police
621	CLINTON	We have to work to make sure that our police are using the best training, the best techniques, that they're well prepared to use force only when necessary.	/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/law enforcement;/law, govt and politics/law enforcement/police;/society/crime/personal offense/assault
622	CLINTON	Everyone should be respected by the law, and everyone should respect the law.	/law, govt and politics/legal issues/legislation/family laws;/law, govt and politics/legal issues/legislation/health care laws
623	CLINTON	Right now, that's not the case in a lot of our neighborhoods.	/law, govt and politics;/real estate/buying and selling homes;/real estate/low income housing;/society/crime;/society/crime/personal offense/homicide;/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/family and parenting/children;/society/crime/property crime
624	CLINTON	So I have, ever since the first day of my campaign, called for criminal justice reform.	/society/crime;/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/politics/lobbying;/society/crime/personal offense;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections;/law, govt and politics/law enforcement;/society/crime/personal offense/assault;/law, govt and politics/government
625	CLINTON	I've laid out a platform that I think would begin to remedy some of the problems we have in the criminal justice system.	/society/crime
626	CLINTON	But we also have to recognize, in addition to the challenges that we face with policing, there are so many good, brave police officers who equally want reform.	/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/law enforcement;/society/crime;/law, govt and politics/law enforcement/police
627	CLINTON	So we have to bring communities together in order to begin working on that as a mutual goal.	/family and parenting/children;/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/society;/society/senior living;/business and industrial/business operations/management/business process;/law, govt and politics;/business and industrial/business operations/human resources/compensation and benefits;/education/teaching and classroom resources;/education/homework and study tips;/education/studying business
628	CLINTON	And we've got to get guns out of the hands of people who should not have them.	/travel/transports;/travel/transports/sea travel;/art and entertainment/shows and events
629	CLINTON	The gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African- American men, more than the next nine causes put together.	/health and fitness/disease/epidemic

711	CLINTON	And it's just a fact that if you're a young African-American man and you do the same thing as a young white man, you are more likely to be arrested, charged, convicted, and incarcerated.	/society;/society/crime;/society/crime/personal offense/homicide;/society/racism;/law, govt and politics;/society/crime/sexual offence/rape;/society/crime/property crime/robbery;/society/crime/personal offense/torture;/law, govt and politics/law enforcement;/society/crime/property crime/arson
712	CLINTON	So we've got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system.	/society/racism
713	CLINTON	We cannot just say law and order.	/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/law enforcement;/society/unrest and war
714	CLINTON	We have to say -- we have to come forward with a plan that is going to divert people from the criminal justice system, deal with mandatory minimum sentences, which have put too many people away for too long for doing too little.	/society/crime;/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/law enforcement
715	CLINTON	We need to have more second chance programs.	/education;/education/studying business;/finance/grants, scholarships and financial aid;/technology and computing/operating systems;/technology and computing/hardware/computer;/education/homework and study tips;/education/teaching and classroom resources;/news/national news;/finance/financial news;/technology and computing/hardware/computer peripherals

720	CLINTON	Right now -- and this is something Donald has supported, along with the gun lobby -- right now, we've got too many military- style weapons on the streets.	/business and industrial/war industry/weaponry;/law, govt and politics/politics/lobbying;/society/crime/personal offense/assault;/real estate/buying and selling homes;/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/society/crime/personal offense/homicide;/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/law, govt and politics/law enforcement;/business and industrial/construction
721	CLINTON	In a lot of places, our police are outgunned.	/law, govt and politics/law enforcement;/law, govt and politics/law enforcement/police;/society/crime
722	CLINTON	We need comprehensive background checks, and we need to keep guns out of the hands of those who will do harm.	/society/crime/personal offense;/law, govt and politics;/society/crime/personal offense/assault;/education/homework and study tips;/law, govt and politics/law enforcement;/family and parenting/children;/health and fitness;/education/teaching and classroom resources;/health and fitness/incest and abuse support;/law, govt and politics/government
723	CLINTON	And we finally need to pass a prohibition on anyone who's on the terrorist watch list from being able to buy a gun in our country.	/society/crime/personal offense;/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/law enforcement;/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/society/crime/personal offense/torture;/religion and spirituality/islam;/religion and spirituality/islam/islamic fundamentalism;/society/crime/personal offense/human trafficking;/society/crime/personal offense/homicide;/law, govt and politics/government
724	CLINTON	If you're too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun.	/automotive and vehicles/buying and selling cars;/sports/fishing/fly fishing
725	CLINTON	So there are things we can do, and we ought to do it in a bipartisan way.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/legislative;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections
726	HOLT	Secretary Clinton, last week, you said we've got to do everything possible to improve policing, to go right at implicit bias.	/society/crime;/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/law enforcement;/society/crime/personal offense/hate crime;/law, govt and politics/law enforcement/police;/society/racism
727	HOLT	Do you believe that police are implicitly biased against black people?	/society/racism;/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/law enforcement;/law, govt and politics/law enforcement/police;/society/crime;/society/crime/personal offense/homicide
728	CLINTON	Lester, I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police.	/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/law enforcement;/law, govt and politics/law enforcement/police;/society/crime;/society/crime/personal offense/homicide;/society/crime/personal offense/hate crime
729	CLINTON	I think, unfortunately, too many of us in our great country jump to conclusions about each other.	/law, govt and politics;/society/unrest and war;/sports/parachuting;/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/business and industrial/business operations;/law, govt and politics/politics;/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/family and parenting/children;/family and parenting/parenting teens;/business and industrial/paper industry
730	CLINTON	And therefore, I think we need all of us to be asking hard questions about, you know, why am I feeling this way?	/family and parenting/children;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/law, govt and politics;/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/society;/health and fitness/sexuality;/family and parenting/babies and toddlers/baby clothes;/business and industrial/business news;/law, govt and politics/politics;/family and parenting/parenting teens
731	CLINTON	But when it comes to policing, since it can have literally fatal consequences, I have said, in my first budget, we would put money into that budget to help us deal with implicit bias by retraining a lot of our police officers.	/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/law enforcement;/society/crime;/finance/grants, scholarships and financial aid/government grants;/law, govt and politics/law enforcement/police
732	CLINTON	I've met with a group of very distinguished, experienced police chiefs a few weeks ago.	/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/law enforcement;/law, govt and politics/law enforcement/police
733	CLINTON	They admit it's an issue.	/society/social institution/divorce;/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/government;/society/crime/property crime;/society/dating;/family and parenting/parenting teens;/society/sex;/family and parenting/adoption;/society/crime/personal offense;/society/unrest and war

735	CLINTON	Mental health is one of the biggest concerns, because now police are having to handle a lot of really difficult mental health problems on the street.	/health and fitness/disorders/mental disorder;/health and fitness/addiction/substance abuse;/health and fitness/disorders/mental disorder/bipolar disorder;/health and fitness/disorders/mental disorder/panic and anxiety

737	CLINTON	And I think the federal government could be in a position where we would offer and provide that.	/law, govt and politics/government;/education/special education;/finance/grants, scholarships and financial aid/government grants;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/education/teaching and classroom resources;/education/studying business;/education/teaching and classroom resources/school supplies;/education/homework and study tips;/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/law, govt and politics/government/executive branch
738	HOLT	Mr. Trump...

740	HOLT	Please.	
741	TRUMP	First of all, I agree, and a lot of people even within my own party want to give certain rights to people on watch lists and no- fly lists.	/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/politics/political parties;/law, govt and politics/government/parliament;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/local elections

743	TRUMP	When a person is on a watch list or a no-fly list, and I have the endorsement of the NRA, which I'm very proud of.	/society/crime/personal offense/hate crime;/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/law, govt and politics/government/government agencies;/law, govt and politics/law enforcement;/law, govt and politics/government/legislative;/society/work;/society/crime/personal offense/human trafficking;/law, govt and politics/immigration
744	TRUMP	These are very, very good people, and they're protecting the Second Amendment.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/legislative;/law, govt and politics/government/parliament
745	TRUMP	But I think we have to look very strongly at no-fly lists and watch lists.	/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/law, govt and politics/government/government agencies;/law, govt and politics/legal issues/human rights;/law, govt and politics/legal issues/civil rights;/law, govt and politics/legal issues/legislation/immigration laws;/travel/traveling with kids;/law, govt and politics/legal issues/death penalty;/law, govt and politics/armed forces/air force;/style and fashion/underwear;/art and entertainment/movies and tv/movies

748	TRUMP	I do want to bring up the fact that you were the one that brought up the words super-predator about young black youth.	/family and parenting/children;/society/racism;/education/english as a second language;/education/homework and study tips;/family and parenting/parenting teens;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/family and parenting/babies and toddlers/baby clothes;/law, govt and politics;/society/unrest and war;/society/teens

755	TRUMP	I think maybe there's a political reason why you can't say it, but I really don't believe -- in New York City, stop-and-frisk, we had 2,200 murders, and stop-and-frisk brought it down to 500 murders.	/society/crime/personal offense/homicide;/law, govt and politics
756	TRUMP	Five hundred murders is a lot of murders.	/society/crime/personal offense/homicide
757	TRUMP	It's hard to believe, 500 is like supposed to be good?	/art and entertainment/shows and events;/society;/style and fashion;/art and entertainment/books and literature;/society/senior living;/style and fashion/body art;/society/dating;/law, govt and politics/politics;/society/unrest and war;/family and parenting/parenting teens

762	TRUMP	Tremendous beyond belief.	/religion and spirituality;/religion and spirituality/christianity

863	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	
864	CLINTON	And clearly, as Donald just admitted, he knew he was going to stand on this debate stage, and Lester Holt was going to be asking us questions, so he tried to put the whole racist birther lie to bed.	/society/racism;/law, govt and politics
865	CLINTON	But it can't be dismissed that easily.	/sports/cricket;/sports/bowling
866	CLINTON	He has really started his political activity based on this racist lie that our first black president was not an American citizen.	/society/racism
867	CLINTON	There was absolutely no evidence for it, but he persisted, he persisted year after year, because some of his supporters, people that he was trying to bring into his fold, apparently believed it or wanted to believe it.	/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/politics;/religion and spirituality/islam;/science/weather;/society/senior living;/religion and spirituality/christianity;/society/crime/personal offense/homicide
868	CLINTON	But, remember, Donald started his career back in 1973 being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African-Americans, and he made sure that the people who worked for him understood that was the policy.	/real estate/apartments

875	CLINTON	And Barack Obama went high, despite Donald Trump's best efforts to bring him down.	/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections

1037	TRUMP	But you look at the Middle East, you started the Iran deal, that's another beauty where you have a country that was ready to fall, I mean, they were doing so badly.	/style and fashion;/style and fashion/beauty

1047	TRUMP	Number one, the 28 countries of NATO, many of them aren't paying their fair share.	/law, govt and politics;/business and industrial/business operations;/society/unrest and war;/society/work;/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/society/work/unemployment;/law, govt and politics/politics/foreign policy;/finance/financial news;/finance/investing/funds;/health and fitness/exercise
1048	TRUMP	Number two -- and that bothers me, because we should be asking -- we're defending them, and they should at least be paying us what they're supposed to be paying by treaty and contract.	/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/real estate/buying and selling homes;/society/unrest and war;/finance/financial news;/finance/investing/funds;/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/finance/investing/beginning investing
1049	TRUMP	And, number two, I said, and very strongly, NATO could be obsolete, because -- and I was very strong on this, and it was actually covered very accurately in the New York Times, which is unusual for the New York Times, to be honest -- but I said, they do not focus on terror.	/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/society/unrest and war;/business and industrial/business operations;/law, govt and politics/politics/foreign policy;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/society/work;/news

1052	TRUMP	And about four months ago, I read on the front page of the Wall Street Journal that NATO is opening up a major terror division.	/finance/financial news;/business and industrial/business operations;/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/politics/foreign policy;/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/finance/bank;/finance/investing;/finance/investing/beginning investing;/society/unrest and war;/business and industrial/business news

1059	TRUMP	And that was -- believe me -- I'm sure I'm not going to get credit for it -- but that was largely because of what I was saying and my criticism of NATO.	/finance/bank;/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/politics/foreign policy;/real estate/buying and selling homes;/finance/financial news;/society/unrest and war;/business and industrial/business operations;/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/finance/investing/funds;/finance/investing/beginning investing
1060	TRUMP	I think we have to get NATO to go into the Middle East with us, in addition to surrounding nations, and we have to knock the hell out of ISIS, and we have to do it fast, when ISIS formed in this vacuum created by Barack Obama and Secretary Clinton.	/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/law, govt and politics/politics/foreign policy

328	COOPER	Secretary Clinton?	/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections
329	CLINTON	Well, I think Donald was about to say he's going to solve it by repealing it and getting rid of the Affordable Care Act.	/health and fitness/drugs;/law, govt and politics/government;/health and fitness/men's health;/health and fitness/dental care
330	CLINTON	And I'm going to fix it, because I agree with you.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/society;/family and parenting;/business and industrial/business software;/automotive and vehicles/buying and selling cars;/family and parenting/babies and toddlers;/hobbies and interests/getting published;/society/unrest and war;/hobbies and interests/games

332	CLINTON	Copays, deductibles, prescription drug costs, and I've laid out a series of actions that we can take to try to get those costs down.	/health and fitness/drugs
333	CLINTON	But here's what I don't want people to forget when we're talking about reining in the costs, which has to be the highest priority of the next president, when the Affordable Care Act passed, it wasn't just that 20 million got insurance who didn't have it before.	/health and fitness/drugs;/law, govt and politics/government;/health and fitness/men's health;/health and fitness/dental care;/family and parenting/eldercare
334	CLINTON	But that in and of itself was a good thing.	/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/health and fitness/sexuality;/society/sex;/society/teens;/family and parenting/parenting teens;/society/sex/pornography;/style and fashion/body art;/law, govt and politics/immigration;/family and parenting/babies and toddlers;/real estate/buying and selling homes
335	CLINTON	I meet these people all the time, and they tell me what a difference having that insurance meant to them and their families.	/family and parenting;/family and parenting/children;/finance/financial news
336	CLINTON	But everybody else, the 170 million of us who get health insurance through our employees got big benefits.	/society/welfare/healthcare
337	CLINTON	Number one, insurance companies can't deny you coverage because of a pre-existing condition.	/health and fitness/drugs;/news/national news;/business and industrial/business news;/sports/sports news;/health and fitness/men's health;/law, govt and politics;/health and fitness/dental care;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/art and entertainment/shows and events/sports event;/family and parenting/eldercare

339	CLINTON	Number three, women can't be charged more than men for our health insurance, which is the way it used to be before the Affordable Care Act.	/health and fitness/drugs;/health and fitness/men's health;/law, govt and politics/government;/health and fitness/women's health;/health and fitness/dental care;/family and parenting/eldercare;/education/special education;/society/sex
340	CLINTON	Number four, if you're under 26, and your parents have a policy, you can be on that policy until the age of 26, something that didn't happen before.	/family and parenting/children;/law, govt and politics
341	CLINTON	So I want very much to save what works and is good about the Affordable Care Act.	/health and fitness/drugs;/law, govt and politics/government;/health and fitness/men's health;/health and fitness/dental care;/family and parenting/eldercare
342	CLINTON	But we've got to get costs down.	/business and industrial/energy/electricity;/business and industrial/energy/renewable energy;/business and industrial/green solutions;/health and fitness/drugs;/finance/investing/funds;/business and industrial/energy/nuclear power;/finance/investing/beginning investing;/finance/financial news;/automotive and vehicles/electric vehicles;/business and industrial/energy/nuclear power/nuclear accident

344	CLINTON	But if we repeal it, as Donald has proposed, and start over again, all of those benefits I just mentioned are lost to everybody, not just people who get their health insurance on the exchange.	/society/welfare/healthcare
345	CLINTON	And then we would have to start all over again.	/sports/boat racing;/sports/baseball;/automotive and vehicles/auto parts;/society/unrest and war;/automotive and vehicles/cars/car culture;/business and industrial/construction;/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/automotive and vehicles/buying and selling cars;/sports/go kart

790	TRUMP	Because she has been a disaster as a senator.	/law, govt and politics/government;/science;/science/weather

793	RADDATZ	The heart-breaking video of a 5-year-old Syrian boy named Omran sitting in an ambulance after being pulled from the rubble after an air strike in Aleppo focused the world's attention on the horrors of the war in Syria, with 136 million views on Facebook alone.	/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/religion and spirituality/islam
794	RADDATZ	But there are much worse images coming out of Aleppo every day now, where in the past few weeks alone, 400 people have been killed, at least 100 of them children.	/family and parenting/children;/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/education/teaching and classroom resources/school supplies
795	RADDATZ	Just days ago, the State Department called for a war crimes investigation of the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad and its ally, Russia, for their bombardment of Aleppo.	/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/law, govt and politics/espionage and intelligence/terrorism;/law, govt and politics/politics/foreign policy;/law, govt and politics/armed forces/army;/business and industrial/war industry/weaponry

799	RADDATZ	Secretary Clinton, we will begin with your two minutes.	/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections
800	CLINTON	Well, the situation in Syria is catastrophic.	/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/religion and spirituality/islam;/law, govt and politics/politics
801	CLINTON	And every day that goes by, we see the results of the regime by Assad in partnership with the Iranians on the ground, the Russians in the air, bombarding places, in particular Aleppo, where there are hundreds of thousands of people, probably about 250,000 still left.	/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/politics;/law, govt and politics/government/heads of state;/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/religion and spirituality/islam
802	CLINTON	And there is a determined effort by the Russian air force to destroy Aleppo in order to eliminate the last of the Syrian rebels who are really holding out against the Assad regime.	/law, govt and politics/armed forces/air force
803	CLINTON	Russia hasn't paid any attention to ISIS.	/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/politics;/family and parenting;/law, govt and politics/politics/foreign policy;/family and parenting/children;/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/religion and spirituality/islam;/travel/traveling with kids;/society/work
804	CLINTON	They're interested in keeping Assad in power.	/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/law, govt and politics/politics;/law, govt and politics/government/heads of state;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/law, govt and politics/politics/foreign policy;/art and entertainment/shows and events
805	CLINTON	So I, when I was secretary of state, advocated and I advocate today a no-fly zone and safe zones.	/law, govt and politics/politics;/law, govt and politics/armed forces/air force;/law, govt and politics/politics/foreign policy;/law, govt and politics/government;/society/unrest and war;/society/welfare/healthcare;/law, govt and politics/armed forces/army;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/society/work
806	CLINTON	We need some leverage with the Russians, because they are not going to come to the negotiating table for a diplomatic resolution, unless there is some leverage over them.	/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/government/embassies and consulates;/law, govt and politics/politics;/finance/investing;/finance/investing/beginning investing;/law, govt and politics/government/heads of state;/law, govt and politics/politics/foreign policy;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement
807	CLINTON	And we have to work more closely with our partners and allies on the ground.	/society/unrest and war;/society/crime/personal offense/assault;/business and industrial/business operations;/law, govt and politics
808	CLINTON	But I want to emphasize that what is at stake here is the ambitions and the aggressiveness of Russia.	/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/politics;/business and industrial/company/joint venture;/business and industrial/company/merger and acquisition;/law, govt and politics/politics/foreign policy;/business and industrial/business operations/business plans
809	CLINTON	Russia has decided that it's all in, in Syria.	/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/politics;/law, govt and politics/government/heads of state
810	CLINTON	And they've also decided who they want to see become president of the United States, too, and it's not me.	/law, govt and politics/government;/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections;/law, govt and politics/government/executive branch;/art and entertainment/shows and events
811	CLINTON	I've stood up to Russia.	/law, govt and politics/politics;/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/politics/foreign policy;/law, govt and politics/politics/domestic policy
812	CLINTON	I've taken on Putin and others, and I would do that as president.	/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/government/heads of state;/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections;/law, govt and politics/politics/foreign policy;/law, govt and politics/government/parliament;/law, govt and politics/espionage and intelligence/terrorism;/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/law, govt and politics/government/executive branch;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement

814	CLINTON	And I did as secretary of state.	/law, govt and politics/politics/foreign policy;/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections
815	CLINTON	That's how we got a treaty reducing nuclear weapons.	/business and industrial/energy/nuclear power;/society/unrest and war;/business and industrial/energy/nuclear power/nuclear accident;/law, govt and politics/armed forces
816	CLINTON	It's how we got the sanctions on Iran that put a lid on the Iranian nuclear program without firing a single shot.	/law, govt and politics/government/heads of state;/law, govt and politics/espionage and intelligence/terrorism;/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/law, govt and politics/politics/foreign policy
817	CLINTON	So I would go to the negotiating table with more leverage than we have now.	/society/unrest and war;/finance/investing;/finance/investing/beginning investing;/law, govt and politics;/finance/financial news;/finance/investing/funds;/finance/bank;/finance/investing/funds/exchange traded funds;/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/finance/investing/stocks

819	RADDATZ	Thank you, Secretary Clinton.	/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections
820	RADDATZ	Mr. Trump?

832	TRUMP	It was laughed at all over the world what happened.	/news/international news;/art and entertainment/shows and events

1137	QUESTION	Perhaps the most important aspect of this election is the Supreme Court justice.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary;/law, govt and politics/legal issues/legislation/family laws;/law, govt and politics/legal issues/civil rights/privacy;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections

1139	RADDATZ	We begin with your two minutes, Secretary Clinton.	/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections
1140	CLINTON	Thank you.	
1141	CLINTON	Well, you're right.	/law, govt and politics;/art and entertainment/movies and tv/movies;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/art and entertainment/movies and tv/movies/reviews;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/society;/art and entertainment/movies and tv/action;/law, govt and politics/politics;/society/sex;/news/national news
1142	CLINTON	This is one of the most important issues in this election.	/law, govt and politics/politics/elections;/law, govt and politics/politics/political parties;/law, govt and politics/government
1143	CLINTON	I want to appoint Supreme Court justices who understand the way the world really works, who have real-life experience, who have not just been in a big law firm and maybe clerked for a judge and then gotten on the bench, but, you know, maybe they tried some more cases, they actually understand what people are up against.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary;/law, govt and politics/legal issues/legislation/family laws;/law, govt and politics/legal issues/civil rights/privacy
1144	CLINTON	Because I think the current court has gone in the wrong direction.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary;/health and fitness/exercise;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/society/crime/personal offense
1145	CLINTON	And so I would want to see the Supreme Court reverse Citizens United and get dark, unaccountable money out of our politics.	/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary;/law, govt and politics/politics;/law, govt and politics/politics/political parties
1146	CLINTON	Donald doesn't agree with that.	/art and entertainment/comics and animation/comics;/society;/hobbies and interests/getting published;/art and entertainment/comics and animation/cartoons;/society/teens;/law, govt and politics/politics/foreign policy;/family and parenting/parenting teens;/law, govt and politics/armed forces
1147	CLINTON	I would like the Supreme Court to understand that voting rights are still a big problem in many parts of our country, that we don't always do everything we can to make it possible for people of color and older people and young people to be able to exercise their franchise.	/health and fitness/exercise
1148	CLINTON	I want a Supreme Court that will stick with Roe v. Wade and a woman's right to choose, and I want a Supreme Court that will stick with marriage equality.	/law, govt and politics/government;/society/sex/sex education;/society/gay life;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary;/health and fitness/women's health;/health and fitness/incest and abuse support;/society/social institution/marriage/common law marriage
1149	CLINTON	Now, Donald has put forth the names of some people that he would consider.	/law, govt and politics;/family and parenting/children;/law, govt and politics/politics;/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/society/racism;/health and fitness;/law, govt and politics/immigration;/religion and spirituality;/society/gay life
1150	CLINTON	And among the ones that he has suggested are people who would reverse Roe v. Wade and reverse marriage equality.	/society/sex/sex education;/law, govt and politics/government;/society/gay life;/health and fitness/incest and abuse support;/health and fitness/women's health;/society/social institution/marriage/common law marriage
1151	CLINTON	I think that would be a terrible mistake and would take us backwards.	/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/law, govt and politics/politics/foreign policy;/business and industrial/construction;/business and industrial/company;/business and industrial/business news;/business and industrial/war industry;/art and entertainment/movies
1152	CLINTON	I want a Supreme Court that doesn't always side with corporate interests.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary;/business and industrial/company;/finance/financial news;/business and industrial/company/earnings;/real estate/buying and selling homes;/law, govt and politics/government/legislative
1153	CLINTON	I want a Supreme Court that understands because you're wealthy and you can give more money to something doesn't mean you have any more rights or should have any more rights than anybody else.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary;/society/social institution/divorce;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/law, govt and politics/government/legislative;/family and parenting;/society/social institution/marriage/common law marriage;/society/gay life
1154	CLINTON	So I have very clear views about what I want to see to kind of change the balance on the Supreme Court.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary;/law, govt and politics/government/executive branch
1155	CLINTON	And I regret deeply that the Senate has not done its job and they have not permitted a vote on the person that President Obama, a highly qualified person, they've not given him a vote to be able to be have the full complement of nine Supreme Court justices.	/law, govt and politics/government;/education/special education
1156	CLINTON	I think that was a dereliction of duty.	/society/crime/personal offense/torture;/law, govt and politics/armed forces/marines;/law, govt and politics/armed forces/navy;/law, govt and politics/armed forces/army;/law, govt and politics/government;/society/crime/sexual offence/rape;/family and parenting/parenting teens;/family and parenting/babies and toddlers/baby clothes;/art and entertainment/movies
1157	CLINTON	I hope that they will see their way to doing it, but if I am so fortunate enough as to be president, I will immediately move to make sure that we fill that, we have nine justices that get to work on behalf of our people.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary;/law, govt and politics/government/executive branch

1169	TRUMP	They'll respect the Second Amendment and what it stands for, what it represents.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/legislative

1225	TRUMP	We have to guard our energy companies.	/business and industrial/energy;/business and industrial/green solutions

1227	TRUMP	The EPA is so restrictive that they are putting our energy companies out of business.	/business and industrial/energy;/business and industrial/green solutions
1228	TRUMP	And all you have to do is go to a great place like West Virginia or places like Ohio, which is phenomenal, or places like Pennsylvania and you see what they're doing to the people, miners and others in the energy business.	/business and industrial/energy;/business and industrial/green solutions;/business and industrial/energy/coal

1235	CLINTON	First of all, China is illegally dumping steel in the United States and Donald Trump is buying it to build his buildings, putting steelworkers and American steel plants out of business.	/business and industrial/iron and steel industry;/society/work
1236	CLINTON	That's something that I fought against as a senator and that I would have a trade prosecutor to make sure that we don't get taken advantage of by China on steel or anything else.	/law, govt and politics/government;/business and industrial/iron and steel industry;/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections;/society/crime/personal offense
1237	CLINTON	You know, because it sounds like you're in the business or you're aware of people in the business -- you know that we are now for the first time ever energy-independent.	/business and industrial;/business and industrial/business operations/management/business process;/business and industrial/business news;/finance/financial news
1238	CLINTON	We are not dependent upon the Middle East.	/law, govt and politics/politics/foreign policy;/religion and spirituality/islam;/religion and spirituality/judaism;/religion and spirituality/islam/islamic fundamentalism;/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/armed forces
1239	CLINTON	But the Middle East still controls a lot of the prices.	/real estate/buying and selling homes;/society/work/unemployment;/finance/financial news;/finance/investing/day trading;/finance/investing/beginning investing;/business and industrial/war industry;/finance/investing/stocks
1240	CLINTON	So the price of oil has been way down.	/business and industrial/energy/oil/oil and gas prices

1242	CLINTON	We are, however, producing a lot of natural gas, which serves as a bridge to more renewable fuels.	/business and industrial/energy/natural gas;/business and industrial/energy/renewable energy/biofuel

1269	RADDATZ	Mr. Trump, would you like to go first?	/sports/go kart
1270	CLINTON	Well, I certainly will, because I think that's a very fair and important question.	/art and entertainment/shows and events/fair
1271	CLINTON	Look, I respect his children.	/family and parenting/children
1272	CLINTON	His children are incredibly able and devoted, and I think that says a lot about Donald.	/family and parenting/children
1273	CLINTON	I don't agree with nearly anything else he says or does, but I do respect that.	/society/social institution/divorce;/law, govt and politics;/family and parenting;/law, govt and politics/politics;/family and parenting/children;/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/religion and spirituality;/society/sex;/society/dating

1277	CLINTON	We are going to be choosing a president who will set policy for not just four or eight years, but because of some of the important decisions we have to make here at home and around the world, from the Supreme Court to energy and so much else, and so there is a lot at stake.	/business and industrial/energy;/business and industrial/green solutions
1278	CLINTON	It's one of the most consequential elections that we've had.	/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections;/law, govt and politics/politics/political parties

194	PENCE	Look, Donald Trump and I have a plan to get this economy moving again just the way that it worked in the 1980s, just the way it worked in the 1960s, and that is by lowering taxes across the board for working families, small businesses and family farms, ending the war on coal that is hurting jobs and hurting this economy even here in Virginia, repealing Obamacare lock, stock, and barrel, and repealing all of the executive orders that Barack Obama has signed that are stifling economic growth in this economy.	/society/work/unemployment;/finance/investing

200	KAINE	Elaine, on the economy, there's a fundamental choice for the American electorate.	/society/work/unemployment;/law, govt and politics/politics;/science/physics/electromagnetism
201	KAINE	Do you want a "you're hired" president in Hillary Clinton or do you want a "you're fired" president in Donald Trump?	/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections;/law, govt and politics/government

203	KAINE	Hillary and I have a plan that's on the table that's a "you're hired" plan.	/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/business and industrial/construction
204	KAINE	Five components.	/technology and computing/hardware/computer components
205	KAINE	First thing we do is we invest in manufacturing, infrastructure, and research in the clean energy jobs of tomorrow.	/business and industrial/manufacturing
206	KAINE	Second thing is we invest in our workforce, from pre-K education to great teachers to debt-free college and tuition-free college for families that make less than $125,000 a year.	/education;/education/studying business;/education/special education;/finance/grants, scholarships and financial aid;/education/school;/education/teaching and classroom resources
207	KAINE	Third, we promote fairness by raising the minimum wage, so you can't work full-time and be under the poverty level, and by paying women equal pay for equal work.	/education/special education;/education/high school;/society/work/unemployment;/law, govt and politics/government
208	KAINE	Fourth, we promote small business growth, just as we've done in Virginia, to make it easier to start and grow small businesses.	/finance/investing;/finance/investing/beginning investing;/business and industrial;/finance/financial news;/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/finance/investing/venture capital;/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/society/work/unemployment;/business and industrial/business software

211	KAINE	And, fifth, we have a tax plan that targets tax relief to middle- class individuals and small businesses and asks those at the very top who've benefited as we've come out of recession to pay more.	/education/special education
212	KAINE	The Trump plan is a different plan.	/business and industrial/construction;/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/government;/real estate;/law, govt and politics/immigration;/society/work/retirement;/finance/investing/funds;/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/law, govt and politics/government/executive branch;/health and fitness/drugs

214	KAINE	And there's two key elements to it.	/business and industrial/business operations;/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/business and industrial/war industry/weaponry;/society/unrest and war;/business and industrial/business operations/management/business process;/business and industrial/logistics;/society/dating;/style and fashion/body art;/law, govt and politics/politics;/sports/fencing
215	KAINE	First, Donald Trump said wages are too high.	/society/work;/society/work/unemployment;/society/welfare/healthcare
216	KAINE	And both Donald Trump and Mike Pence think we ought to eliminate the federal minimum wage.	/society/welfare/healthcare

219	KAINE	The second component of the plan is massive tax breaks for the very top, trillions of dollars of tax breaks for people just like Donald Trump.	/finance/bank;/finance/investing/funds;/society/work/unemployment;/finance/investing/beginning investing;/finance/financial news;/law, govt and politics/government;/finance/grants, scholarships and financial aid/government grants;/real estate/buying and selling homes;/business and industrial/construction;/real estate/low income housing
220	KAINE	The problem with this, Elaine, is that's exactly what we did 10 years ago and it put the economy into the deepest recession -- the deepest recession since the 1930s.	/society/work/unemployment;/finance/bank
221	KAINE	Independent analysts say the Clinton plan would grow the economy by 10.5 million jobs.	/society/work/unemployment;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections

223	KAINE	And Donald Trump -- why would he do this?	/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections
224	KAINE	Because his tax plan basically helps him.	/business and industrial/company/earnings;/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/finance/investing/funds;/real estate/buying and selling homes
225	KAINE	And if he ever met his promise and he gave his tax returns to the American public like he said he would, we would see just how much his economic plan is really a Trump-first plan.	/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/law, govt and politics/politics;/society/work/unemployment;/society/unrest and war;/careers/career planning;/finance/investing;/finance/investing/beginning investing;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/finance/investing/funds;/finance/financial news

1252	KAINE	Governor Pence wants to repeal Roe v. Wade.	/law, govt and politics/government;/society/sex/sex education;/health and fitness/incest and abuse support;/health and fitness/women's health;/health and fitness/drugs

1256	KAINE	Before Roe v. Wade, states could pass criminal laws to do just that, to punish women if they made the choice to terminate a pregnancy.	/family and parenting/motherhood/pregnancy
