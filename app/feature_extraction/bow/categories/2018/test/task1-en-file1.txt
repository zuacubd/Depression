13	WALLACE	Let's get right to it.	/art and entertainment/music/recording industry/music awards;/art and entertainment/shows and events/concert;/law, govt and politics;/art and entertainment/music/singing;/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/art and entertainment/dance;/art and entertainment/celebrity fan and gossip;/society;/society/sex

15	WALLACE	You both talked briefly about the court in the last debate, but I want to drill down on this, because the next president will almost certainly have at least one appointment and likely or possibly two or three appointments.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary;/law, govt and politics/government/parliament;/law, govt and politics/government/executive branch;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections
16	WALLACE	Which means that you will, in effect, determine the balance of the court for what could be the next quarter century.	/law, govt and politics/government;/health and fitness/exercise;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary;/sports/cricket;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/finance/financial news;/law, govt and politics/government/legislative;/society/work;/society/work/unemployment;/family and parenting/children

18	WALLACE	And secondly, what's your view on how the Constitution should be interpreted?	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/parliament;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary
19	WALLACE	Do the founders' words mean what they say or is it a living document to be applied flexibly according to changing circumstances?	/family and parenting/children;/education/english as a second language;/society/crime/property crime;/law, govt and politics;/education/homework and study tips;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/society/senior living;/health and fitness/exercise;/society/social institution/divorce;/business and industrial/business software
20	WALLACE	In this segment, Secretary Clinton, you go first.	/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections
21	WALLACE	You have two minutes.	/sports/curling;/sports/handball;/sports/auto racing;/sports/football;/sports/boat racing;/travel/transports
22	CLINTON	Thank you very much, Chris.	/business and industrial/company/bankruptcy;/business and industrial/green solutions;/sports/olympics;/hobbies and interests/home recording;/business and industrial/company/earnings
23	CLINTON	And thanks to UNLV for hosting us.	/sports/basketball;/business and industrial;/art and entertainment/shows and events/sports event;/business and industrial/business operations;/travel/business travel;/sports/olympics;/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/art and entertainment/shows and events/conference;/business and industrial/business news;/sports/hunting and shooting
24	CLINTON	You know, I think when we talk about the Supreme Court, it really raises the central issue in this election, namely, what kind of country are we going to be?	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary;/law, govt and politics/politics/political parties;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections
25	CLINTON	What kind of opportunities will we provide for our citizens?	/law, govt and politics;/education/studying business;/education/teaching and classroom resources;/law, govt and politics/politics;/education/homework and study tips;/law, govt and politics/immigration;/technology and computing/internet technology;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/family and parenting/children;/careers/career planning
26	CLINTON	What kind of rights will Americans have?	/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/immigration;/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/politics;/society/work;/society/gay life;/family and parenting;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/law, govt and politics/politics/foreign policy
27	CLINTON	And I feel strongly that the Supreme Court needs to stand on the side of the American people, not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy.	/law, govt and politics/government;/business and industrial/company;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary;/business and industrial/company/earnings;/society/work;/law, govt and politics/politics;/finance/financial news;/law, govt and politics/government/executive branch
28	CLINTON	For me, that means that we need a Supreme Court that will stand up on behalf of women's rights, on behalf of the rights of the LGBT community, that will stand up and say no to Citizens United, a decision that has undermined the election system in our country because of the way it permits dark, unaccountable money to come into our electoral system.	/law, govt and politics;/health and fitness/women's health;/society/gay life;/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/politics/political parties;/law, govt and politics/government/parliament;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement
29	CLINTON	I have major disagreements with my opponent about these issues and others that will be before the Supreme Court.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary;/law, govt and politics/government/executive branch
30	CLINTON	But I feel that at this point in our country's history, it is important that we not reverse marriage equality, that we not reverse Roe v. Wade, that we stand up against Citizens United, we stand up for the rights of people in the workplace, that we stand up and basically say: The Supreme Court should represent all of us.	/law, govt and politics/government;/society/sex/sex education;/society/gay life;/health and fitness/incest and abuse support;/health and fitness/women's health;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary;/society/social institution/marriage/common law marriage;/society/work;/law, govt and politics/government/legislative
31	CLINTON	That's how I see the court, and the kind of people that I would be looking to nominate to the court would be in the great tradition of standing up to the powerful, standing up on behalf of our rights as Americans.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary;/society/unrest and war;/family and parenting/children
32	CLINTON	And I look forward to having that opportunity.	/education/teaching and classroom resources;/education/studying business;/finance/grants, scholarships and financial aid;/careers/career planning;/education/homework and study tips;/education/teaching and classroom resources/school supplies;/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/business and industrial/business operations/management/business process;/education/school;/careers/job fairs
33	CLINTON	I would hope that the Senate would do its job and confirm the nominee that President Obama has sent to them.	/law, govt and politics/government
34	CLINTON	That's the way the Constitution fundamentally should operate.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/parliament;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary
35	CLINTON	The president nominates, and then the Senate advises and consents, or not, but they go forward with the process.	/law, govt and politics/government
36	WALLACE	Secretary Clinton, thank you.	/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections
37	WALLACE	Mr. Trump, same question.	/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections
38	WALLACE	Where do you want to see the court take the country?	/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/society/unrest and war;/society/crime/personal offense
39	WALLACE	And how do you believe the Constitution should be interpreted?	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/parliament;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary
40	TRUMP	Well, first of all, it's great to be with you, and thank you, everybody.	/society/unrest and war;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/style and fashion;/society/senior living;/law, govt and politics/politics;/sports/go kart;/society/dating;/style and fashion/body art;/family and parenting/children
41	TRUMP	The Supreme Court: It's what it's all about.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary;/law, govt and politics/legal issues/legislation/family laws;/law, govt and politics/legal issues/civil rights/privacy
42	TRUMP	Our country is so, so -- it's just so imperative that we have the right justices.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement
43	TRUMP	Something happened recently where Justice Ginsburg made some very, very inappropriate statements toward me and toward a tremendous number of people, many, many millions of people that I represent.	/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/government;/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/politics;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/society/racism;/art and entertainment/shows and events
44	TRUMP	And she was forced to apologize.	/society/unrest and war;/society/social institution/divorce;/law, govt and politics;/family and parenting/children;/law, govt and politics/politics;/business and industrial/business operations;/travel/transports;/travel/traveling with kids
45	TRUMP	And apologize she did.	/society;/law, govt and politics;/family and parenting/babies and toddlers;/society/racism;/society/dating;/pets/large animals;/sports/paintball;/sports/go kart;/sports/wrestling;/society/teens
46	TRUMP	But these were statements that should never, ever have been made.	/law, govt and politics;/society/crime/personal offense;/society/crime/personal offense/homicide;/law, govt and politics/law enforcement;/law, govt and politics/government
47	TRUMP	We need a Supreme Court that in my opinion is going to uphold the Second Amendment, and all amendments, but the Second Amendment, which is under absolute siege.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/legislative;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary
48	TRUMP	I believe if my opponent should win this race, which I truly don't think will happen, we will have a Second Amendment which will be a very, very small replica of what it is right now.	/sports/auto racing/nascar;/automotive and vehicles/auto parts;/automotive and vehicles/cars/car culture;/sports/boat racing;/law, govt and politics/government;/automotive and vehicles/cars/performance vehicles;/automotive and vehicles/buying and selling cars;/automotive and vehicles/cars/vintage cars
49	TRUMP	But I feel that it's absolutely important that we uphold, because of the fact that it is under such trauma.	/health and fitness/disorders/mental disorder/panic and anxiety;/family and parenting/children;/health and fitness/therapy;/law, govt and politics;/health and fitness/incest and abuse support;/education/homework and study tips;/society;/society/unrest and war;/health and fitness/sexuality;/art and entertainment/shows and events
50	TRUMP	I feel that the justices that I am going to appoint -- and I've named 20 of them -- the justices that I'm going to appoint will be pro-life.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary
51	TRUMP	They will have a conservative bent.	/law, govt and politics/politics/domestic policy;/society/welfare/healthcare;/society/work;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections;/society/work/unemployment;/religion and spirituality/judaism;/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/politics/political parties;/religion and spirituality/christianity/orthodoxy;/society/gay life
52	TRUMP	They will be protecting the Second Amendment.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/legislative;/law, govt and politics/government/parliament
53	TRUMP	They are great scholars in all cases, and they're people of tremendous respect.	/religion and spirituality/hinduism;/health and fitness/disease;/law, govt and politics;/health and fitness/disease/epidemic;/family and parenting/children;/society;/health and fitness/disease/cold and flu;/religion and spirituality/islam;/society/crime/personal offense;/religion and spirituality/christianity
54	TRUMP	They will interpret the Constitution the way the founders wanted it interpreted.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary;/law, govt and politics/government/parliament
55	TRUMP	And I believe that's very, very important.	/religion and spirituality/christianity;/religion and spirituality/islam;/religion and spirituality/christianity/protestantism;/law, govt and politics/politics;/religion and spirituality/christianity/orthodoxy;/religion and spirituality/christianity/latter-day saints;/society/sex;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/education/homework and study tips;/family and parenting/children
56	TRUMP	I don't think we should have justices appointed that decide what they want to hear.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary
57	TRUMP	It's all about the Constitution of -- of -- and so important, the Constitution the way it was meant to be.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/parliament;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary
58	TRUMP	And those are the people that I will appoint.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/parliament;/law, govt and politics/government/executive branch;/law, govt and politics/government/heads of state
59	WALLACE	Mr. Trump, thank you.	/real estate;/law, govt and politics/immigration;/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/executive branch;/society/racism;/society/gay life
60	WALLACE	We now have about 10 minutes for an open discussion.	/sports/tennis
61	WALLACE	I want to focus on two issues that, in fact, by the justices that you name could end up changing the existing law of the land.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary;/law, govt and politics/government/parliament
62	WALLACE	First is one that you mentioned, Mr. Trump, and that is guns.	/travel/transports;/travel/transports/sea travel;/law, govt and politics;/real estate;/law, govt and politics/immigration;/law, govt and politics/armed forces/navy
63	WALLACE	Secretary Clinton, you said last year, let me quote, "The Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment."	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary
64	WALLACE	And now, in fact, in the 2008 Heller case, the court ruled that there is a constitutional right to bear arms, but a right that is reasonably limited.	/law, govt and politics/government;/society/crime;/society/crime/personal offense;/society/crime/property crime;/law, govt and politics/government/legislative;/business and industrial/war industry;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement
65	WALLACE	Those were the words of the Judge Antonin Scalia who wrote the decision.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary;/law, govt and politics/government/executive branch;/law, govt and politics/government/legislative;/society/crime/property crime/fraud
66	WALLACE	What's wrong with that?	/society;/society/sex;/law, govt and politics;/sports/go kart;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/health and fitness/sexuality;/health and fitness/incest and abuse support;/style and fashion/body art;/family and parenting/children;/society/senior living
67	CLINTON	Well, first of all, I support the Second Amendment.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/legislative
68	CLINTON	I lived in Arkansas for 18 wonderful years.	/science/weather/meteorological disaster/tornado;/society/senior living;/law, govt and politics;/family and parenting/children;/law, govt and politics/government;/education/teaching and classroom resources;/law, govt and politics/government/state and local government;/education/teaching and classroom resources/school supplies;/society/dating;/religion and spirituality/judaism
69	CLINTON	I represented upstate New York.	/business and industrial/business news;/law, govt and politics/government;/news/national news;/business and industrial/company/merger and acquisition;/society/gay life;/law, govt and politics/immigration;/real estate/buying and selling homes;/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/law, govt and politics/government/legislative;/real estate/low income housing
70	CLINTON	I understand and respect the tradition of gun ownership.	/real estate/buying and selling homes;/religion and spirituality/hinduism;/law, govt and politics/politics;/family and parenting/children;/religion and spirituality/buddhism;/news;/society;/religion and spirituality/christianity;/religion and spirituality/christianity/orthodoxy;/business and industrial/business news
71	CLINTON	It goes back to the founding of our country.	/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/politics;/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/immigration;/law, govt and politics/politics/political parties;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/society/work/unemployment;/law, govt and politics/government/heads of state
72	CLINTON	But I also believe that there can be and must be reasonable regulation.	/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/society/crime/property crime;/finance/financial news;/finance/bank/checks;/family and parenting/children;/health and fitness/exercise;/religion and spirituality/christianity;/law, govt and politics/government/legislative;/society/crime/property crime/fraud
73	CLINTON	Because I support the Second Amendment doesn't mean that I want people who shouldn't have guns to be able to threaten you, kill you or members of your family.	/law, govt and politics/government;/travel/transports;/society/crime/personal offense/assault;/travel/transports/sea travel;/society/unrest and war;/travel/traveling with kids;/family and parenting;/law, govt and politics/government/legislative;/style and fashion/body art;/society/crime/personal offense/homicide
74	CLINTON	And so when I think about what we need to do, we have 33,000 people a year who die from guns.	/travel/transports;/travel/transports/sea travel;/education/homework and study tips;/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/immigration;/health and fitness;/society;/education/teaching and classroom resources;/education/teaching and classroom resources/school supplies
75	CLINTON	I think we need comprehensive background checks, need to close the online loophole, close the gun show loophole.	/technology and computing/internet technology;/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/law enforcement;/society/crime/property crime;/education/homework and study tips;/education/teaching and classroom resources;/law, govt and politics/government;/technology and computing/internet technology/internet cafes;/technology and computing/internet technology/social network;/family and parenting/children
76	CLINTON	There's other matters that I think are sensible that are the kind of reforms that would make a difference that are not in any way conflicting with the Second Amendment.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/politics;/law, govt and politics/government/legislative;/law, govt and politics/government/parliament;/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary
77	CLINTON	You mentioned the Heller decision.	/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/society;/health and fitness/exercise;/law, govt and politics/government/legislative
78	CLINTON	And what I was saying that you referenced, Chris, was that I disagreed with the way the court applied the Second Amendment in that case, because what the District of Columbia was trying to do was to protect toddlers from guns and so they wanted people with guns to safely store them.	/family and parenting/babies and toddlers/baby food;/law, govt and politics/government;/travel/transports
79	CLINTON	And the court didn't accept that reasonable regulation, but they've accepted many others.	/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary;/society/crime/property crime/fraud;/finance/financial news;/finance/bank/checks;/health and fitness/exercise;/law, govt and politics/government/legislative;/society/crime/personal offense
80	CLINTON	So I see no conflict between saving people's lives and defending the Second Amendment.	/law, govt and politics/government;/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/politics;/law, govt and politics/government/parliament;/law, govt and politics/politics/political parties;/law, govt and politics/government/legislative
81	WALLACE	Let me bring Mr. Trump in here.	/law, govt and politics/immigration;/real estate;/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/real estate/buying and selling homes;/law, govt and politics/government/executive branch;/travel/traveling with kids;/society/racism;/business and industrial/business news;/news
82	WALLACE	The bipartisan Open Debate Coalition got millions of votes on questions to ask here, and this was, in fact, one of the top questions that they got.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections;/law, govt and politics/politics/political parties;/law, govt and politics/government/parliament;/law, govt and politics/government/legislative;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/local elections;/society/unrest and war
83	WALLACE	How will you ensure the Second Amendment is protected?	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/legislative;/law, govt and politics/government/parliament
84	WALLACE	You just heard Secretary Clinton's answer.	/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections;/law, govt and politics/government
85	WALLACE	Does she persuade you that, while you may disagree on regulation, that, in fact, she supports a Second Amendment right to bear arms?	/law, govt and politics;/business and industrial/war industry;/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/politics/lobbying;/society/crime/personal offense/hate crime;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement
86	TRUMP	Well, the D.C. vs. Heller decision was very strongly -- and she was extremely angry about it.	/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/government;/business and industrial/construction;/real estate/buying and selling homes;/society;/family and parenting/parenting teens;/travel/traveling with kids;/society/dating;/society/work;/society/senior living
87	TRUMP	I watched.	
88	TRUMP	I mean, she was very, very angry when upheld.	/society/social institution/divorce;/law, govt and politics;/society/crime/property crime;/law, govt and politics/government;/family and parenting/children;/family and parenting/babies and toddlers
89	TRUMP	And Justice Scalia was so involved.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/executive branch;/society/crime
90	TRUMP	And it was a well-crafted decision.	/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/law, govt and politics/government/legislative;/law, govt and politics/government/parliament;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary
91	TRUMP	But Hillary was extremely upset, extremely angry.	/society/dating;/family and parenting/babies and toddlers;/travel/traveling with kids;/sports/tennis;/sports/go kart;/family and parenting/parenting teens;/travel/honeymoons and getaways;/family and parenting/children;/pets/large animals;/style and fashion/body art
92	TRUMP	And people that believe in the Second Amendment and believe in it very strongly were very upset with what she had to say.	/law, govt and politics/government;/religion and spirituality/christianity;/society/sex;/religion and spirituality/islam;/society/social institution/divorce;/law, govt and politics/politics;/religion and spirituality/christianity/latter-day saints;/society/social institution/marriage;/law, govt and politics/politics/lobbying
93	WALLACE	Well, let me bring in Secretary Clinton.	/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections
94	WALLACE	Were you extremely upset?	/sports/tennis;/society/dating
95	CLINTON	Well, I was upset because, unfortunately, dozens of toddlers injure themselves, even kill people with guns, because, unfortunately, not everyone who has loaded guns in their homes takes appropriate precautions.	/family and parenting/babies and toddlers/baby food;/travel/transports;/travel/transports/sea travel
96	CLINTON	But there's no doubt that I respect the Second Amendment, that I also believe there's an individual right to bear arms.	/law, govt and politics/government;/society;/law, govt and politics/politics/lobbying;/society/crime/personal offense/homicide;/society/crime/personal offense/hate crime;/law, govt and politics/government/legislative
97	CLINTON	That is not in conflict with sensible, commonsense regulation.	/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics;/business and industrial/war industry;/law, govt and politics/politics;/finance/financial news
98	CLINTON	And, you know, look, I understand that Donald's been strongly supported by the NRA.	/family and parenting/children;/law, govt and politics/politics/lobbying;/society/work;/style and fashion;/law, govt and politics/government;/family and parenting/babies and toddlers/baby clothes;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/family and parenting/parenting teens;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections;/law, govt and politics/politics/foreign policy
99	CLINTON	The gun lobby's on his side.	/sports/hunting and shooting;/sports/hunting and shooting/target shooting;/society/crime/personal offense/homicide;/automotive and vehicles/vehicle brands;/real estate/buying and selling homes;/society/crime/personal offense/assault;/law, govt and politics;/real estate/architects
100	CLINTON	They're running millions of dollars of ads against me.	/business and industrial/advertising and marketing/advertising;/business and industrial/advertising and marketing/marketing
101	CLINTON	And I regret that, because what I would like to see is for people to come together and say: Of course we're going to protect and defend the Second Amendment.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/executive branch;/law, govt and politics/government/parliament
102	CLINTON	But we're going to do it in a way that tries to save some of these 33,000 lives that we lose every year.	/art and entertainment/shows and events;/health and fitness/weight loss;/family and parenting;/family and parenting/parenting teens;/art and entertainment/shows and events/sports event;/society;/family and parenting/babies and toddlers/baby clothes;/family and parenting/children;/sports/go kart;/art and entertainment/shows and events/festival
103	WALLACE	Let me bring Mr. Trump back into this, because, in fact, you oppose any limits on assault weapons, any limits on high- capacity magazines.	/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/law enforcement;/law, govt and politics/immigration;/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/real estate/buying and selling homes;/society/sex
104	WALLACE	You support a national right to carry law.	/news/national news;/law, govt and politics
105	WALLACE	Why, sir?	
106	TRUMP	Well, let me just tell you before we go any further.	/society/social institution/divorce;/family and parenting/babies and toddlers/baby clothes;/society/dating
107	TRUMP	In Chicago, which has the toughest gun laws in the United States, probably you could say by far, they have more gun violence than any other city.	/society/crime/personal offense/homicide;/sports/hunting and shooting;/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/law enforcement;/society/crime/personal offense/hate crime;/society/crime/property crime/larceny;/sports/hunting and shooting/target shooting;/law, govt and politics/government
108	TRUMP	So we have the toughest laws, and you have tremendous gun violence.	/law, govt and politics;/society/crime;/society/crime/personal offense/homicide;/sports/hunting and shooting;/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/law enforcement;/law, govt and politics/government/legislative;/society/sex;/society/crime/personal offense/hate crime;/society/crime/sexual offence/prostitution
109	TRUMP	I am a very strong supporter of the Second Amendment.	/law, govt and politics/government
110	TRUMP	And I am -- I don't know if Hillary was saying it in a sarcastic manner, but I'm very proud to have the endorsement of the NRA.	/sports/hunting and shooting;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections;/law, govt and politics/government;/sports/hunting and shooting/target shooting;/law, govt and politics/politics/foreign policy;/law, govt and politics/politics/lobbying;/society/gay life;/society/work;/family and parenting;/law, govt and politics/government/legislative
111	TRUMP	And it's the earliest endorsement they've ever given to anybody who ran for president.	/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections;/law, govt and politics/government;/society/dating;/art and entertainment/movies and tv/movies/reviews
112	TRUMP	So I'm very honored by all of that.	/art and entertainment/shows and events/concert;/art and entertainment/movies;/society/gay life;/art and entertainment/celebrity fan and gossip;/art and entertainment/movies/film festivals and awards;/careers/career planning;/careers/job fairs;/sports/baseball;/art and entertainment/shows and events/classical concert;/family and parenting/parenting teens
113	TRUMP	We are going to appoint justices -- this is the best way to help the Second Amendment.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary
114	TRUMP	We are going to appoint justices that will feel very strongly about the Second Amendment, that will not do damage to the Second Amendment.	/law, govt and politics/government
115	WALLACE	Well, let's pick up on another issue which divides you and the justices that whoever ends up winning this election appoints could have a dramatic effect there, and that's the issue of abortion.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary;/society/sex;/society/sex/sex education
116	TRUMP	Right.	
117	WALLACE	Mr. Trump, you're pro-life.	/law, govt and politics/immigration;/law, govt and politics/government;/society/sex/sex education;/real estate;/society/gay life;/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/law, govt and politics/government/executive branch;/society/racism;/news/national news;/art and entertainment/shows and events
118	WALLACE	But I want to ask you specifically: Do you want the court, including the justices that you will name, to overturn Roe v. Wade, which includes -- in fact, states -- a woman's right to abortion?	/family and parenting/motherhood/pregnancy;/society/sex/sex education;/law, govt and politics/government;/health and fitness/women's health;/health and fitness/incest and abuse support
119	TRUMP	Well, if that would happen, because I am pro-life, and I will be appointing pro-life judges, I would think that that will go back to the individual states.	/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary;/society/sex/sex education
120	WALLACE	But I'm asking you specifically.	/family and parenting/children;/law, govt and politics;/society;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/society/sex;/health and fitness/sexuality;/society/gay life;/family and parenting/babies and toddlers/baby clothes;/family and parenting/parenting teens;/health and fitness/addiction
121	WALLACE	Would you like to...	/art and entertainment/shows and events/classical concert;/art and entertainment/shows and events/concert;/art and entertainment/movies and tv/movies/reviews;/art and entertainment/music/music reference;/law, govt and politics/politics;/religion and spirituality/islam;/art and entertainment/movies and tv/action;/news;/art and entertainment/music/singing;/religion and spirituality/atheism and agnosticism
122	TRUMP	If they overturned it, it will go back to the states.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/legislative;/society;/law, govt and politics/government/executive branch;/society/crime
123	WALLACE	But what I'm asking you, sir, is, do you want to see the court overturn -- you just said you want to see the court protect the Second Amendment.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary;/law, govt and politics/government/legislative
124	WALLACE	Do you want to see the court overturn Roe v. Wade?	/family and parenting/motherhood/pregnancy;/society/sex/sex education;/law, govt and politics/government;/health and fitness/incest and abuse support;/health and fitness/women's health;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary
125	TRUMP	Well, if we put another two or perhaps three justice on, that's really what's going to be -- that will happen.	/art and entertainment/shows and events;/society/dating;/sports/go kart;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary;/family and parenting/parenting teens;/society/senior living;/family and parenting/children;/society/unrest and war;/society/teens;/style and fashion
126	TRUMP	And that'll happen automatically, in my opinion, because I am putting pro-life justices on the court.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary
127	TRUMP	I will say this: It will go back to the states, and the states will then make a determination.	/law, govt and politics/government;/family and parenting/children;/society/social institution/divorce;/society/unrest and war;/society/crime/property crime;/law, govt and politics/government/executive branch;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/law, govt and politics/politics
128	WALLACE	Secretary Clinton?	/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections
129	CLINTON	Well, I strongly support Roe v. Wade, which guarantees a constitutional right to a woman to make the most intimate, most difficult, in many cases, decisions about her health care that one can imagine.	/law, govt and politics/government;/society/sex/sex education;/health and fitness/women's health;/health and fitness/drugs;/health and fitness/men's health;/health and fitness/incest and abuse support;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary;/law, govt and politics/government/legislative
130	CLINTON	And in this case, it's not only about Roe v. Wade.	/family and parenting/motherhood/pregnancy;/society/sex/sex education;/law, govt and politics/government;/health and fitness/incest and abuse support;/health and fitness/women's health;/health and fitness/drugs
131	CLINTON	It is about what's happening right now in America.	/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/politics;/society;/law, govt and politics/immigration;/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/society/unrest and war;/society/racism;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/news/national news
132	CLINTON	So many states are putting very stringent regulations on women that block them from exercising that choice to the extent that they are defunding Planned Parenthood, which, of course, provides all kinds of cancer screenings and other benefits for women in our country.	/health and fitness/women's health;/society/welfare/healthcare;/society/sex;/family and parenting/motherhood/pregnancy;/law, govt and politics;/health and fitness/sexuality;/society/sex/sex education
133	CLINTON	Donald has said he's in favor of defunding Planned Parenthood.	/society/sex/sex education;/law, govt and politics/government;/health and fitness/women's health;/health and fitness/incest and abuse support;/society/unrest and war
134	CLINTON	He even supported shutting the government down to defund Planned Parenthood.	/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/politics;/society/sex/sex education;/law, govt and politics/government/parliament;/law, govt and politics/politics/political parties;/society/work
135	CLINTON	I will defend Planned Parenthood.	/society/sex/sex education;/health and fitness/women's health;/law, govt and politics/government;/society/unrest and war
136	CLINTON	I will defend Roe v. Wade, and I will defend women's rights to make their own health care decisions.	/health and fitness/women's health
137	WALLACE	Secretary Clinton…	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/politics;/law, govt and politics/government/executive branch;/society/welfare/healthcare;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/finance;/law, govt and politics/government/state and local government;/law, govt and politics/politics/domestic policy;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections;/law, govt and politics/politics/foreign policy
138	CLINTON	And we have come too far to have that turned back now.	/travel/transports;/travel/transports/sea travel;/society/unrest and war
139	WALLACE	And, indeed, he said women should be punished, that there should be some form of punishment for women who obtain abortions.	/health and fitness/women's health;/family and parenting/motherhood/pregnancy;/society/sex;/society/crime;/society/crime/sexual offence/rape;/society/sex/sex education;/health and fitness/incest and abuse support;/society/crime/sexual offence/prostitution
140	WALLACE	And I could just not be more opposed to that kind of thinking.	/law, govt and politics/politics;/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/government;/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/society/work;/society/social institution/divorce
141	WALLACE	I'm going to give you a chance to respond, but I want to ask you, Secretary Clinton, I want to explore how far you believe the right to abortion goes.	/society/sex;/society/sex/sex education;/family and parenting;/health and fitness/women's health;/law, govt and politics/government;/family and parenting/children;/health and fitness/incest and abuse support;/health and fitness/sexuality;/family and parenting/babies and toddlers
142	WALLACE	You have been quoted as saying that the fetus has no constitutional rights.	/family and parenting/babies and toddlers;/law, govt and politics/government;/health and fitness/disease/infertility;/family and parenting/children;/health and fitness/disease/thyroid disease;/society;/health and fitness/women's health;/health and fitness/incest and abuse support;/health and fitness/disease/diabetes;/society/sex
143	WALLACE	You also voted against a ban on late-term, partial-birth abortions.	/society/sex/sex education;/health and fitness/women's health;/law, govt and politics/government;/health and fitness/incest and abuse support;/society/gay life;/family and parenting
144	WALLACE	Why?	
145	CLINTON	Because Roe v. Wade very clearly sets out that there can be regulations on abortion so long as the life and the health of the mother are taken into account.	/family and parenting/motherhood/pregnancy;/health and fitness/men's health;/society/sex/sex education;/health and fitness/women's health;/law, govt and politics/government
146	CLINTON	And when I voted as a senator, I did not think that that was the case.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections
147	CLINTON	The kinds of cases that fall at the end of pregnancy are often the most heartbreaking, painful decisions for families to make.	/health and fitness/disease/infertility;/family and parenting;/family and parenting/children;/family and parenting/babies and toddlers;/society/sex;/health and fitness/disease/thyroid disease;/society/sex/sex education;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary;/health and fitness/therapy
148	CLINTON	I have met with women who toward the end of their pregnancy get the worst news one could get, that their health is in jeopardy if they continue to carry to term or that something terrible has happened or just been discovered about the pregnancy.	/family and parenting/motherhood/pregnancy
149	CLINTON	I do not think the United States government should be stepping in and making those most personal of decisions.	/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/law, govt and politics/politics;/law, govt and politics/government/parliament;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary;/society/unrest and war;/society/work/unemployment
150	CLINTON	So you can regulate if you are doing so with the life and the health of the mother taken into account.	/health and fitness/men's health
151	WALLACE	Mr. Trump, your reaction?	/science/chemistry/organic chemistry
152	WALLACE	And particularly on this issue of late-term, partial-birth abortions.	/family and parenting/motherhood/pregnancy;/society/sex/sex education
153	TRUMP	Well, I think it's terrible.	/society/social institution/divorce;/society/unrest and war;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/sports/hunting and shooting;/style and fashion;/family and parenting/parenting teens;/society/dating;/law, govt and politics/government;/art and entertainment/books and literature;/health and fitness/sexuality
154	TRUMP	If you go with what Hillary is saying, in the ninth month, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby.	/family and parenting/babies and toddlers;/society/social institution/divorce
155	TRUMP	Now, you can say that that's OK and Hillary can say that that's OK.	/society/social institution/divorce;/law, govt and politics;/society/sex;/family and parenting/children;/news;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/society/gay life;/family and parenting/babies and toddlers/baby clothes;/health and fitness/incest and abuse support
156	TRUMP	But it's not OK with me, because based on what she's saying, and based on where she's going, and where she's been, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month on the final day.	/family and parenting/babies and toddlers
157	TRUMP	And that's not acceptable.	/sports/scuba diving;/sports/diving;/society/sex;/style and fashion/clothing;/society/social institution;/society/social institution/marriage;/health and fitness/sexuality;/society/social institution/divorce;/family and parenting/children
158	CLINTON	Well, that is not what happens in these cases.	/health and fitness/disease;/health and fitness/disease/epidemic;/health and fitness/disease/cold and flu;/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary;/family and parenting/children;/society/crime/personal offense;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/society/crime/sexual offence/rape;/health and fitness/incest and abuse support
159	CLINTON	And using that kind of scare rhetoric is just terribly unfortunate.	/law, govt and politics/politics;/society/unrest and war;/art and entertainment/books and literature;/family and parenting;/style and fashion/body art;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/society/racism;/family and parenting/parenting teens;/art and entertainment/books and literature/poetry;/education/teaching and classroom resources
160	CLINTON	You should meet with some of the women that I have met with, women I have known over the course of my life.	/health and fitness/women's health;/society/sex;/family and parenting/motherhood;/health and fitness/sexuality
161	CLINTON	This is one of the worst possible choices that any woman and her family has to make.	/family and parenting;/society/social institution/divorce;/family and parenting/children;/society/social institution/marriage;/family and parenting/motherhood/pregnancy;/society/sex;/health and fitness/sexuality;/health and fitness/women's health;/family and parenting/babies and toddlers/baby clothes;/society/dating

219	WALLACE	Basically, why are you right and Mr. Trump is wrong?	/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections
220	CLINTON	Well, as he was talking, I was thinking about a young girl I met here in Las Vegas, Carla, who is very worried that her parents might be deported, because she was born in this country but they were not.	/family and parenting/children;/law, govt and politics/immigration;/society/unrest and war;/travel/traveling with kids;/religion and spirituality/judaism;/family and parenting/babies and toddlers;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/family and parenting/adoption;/society/dating
221	CLINTON	They work hard, they do everything they can to give her a good life.	/society/social institution/divorce;/family and parenting/children;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/society/senior living;/style and fashion/body art;/family and parenting/babies and toddlers/baby clothes;/pets/large animals;/society/dating;/religion and spirituality/hinduism
222	CLINTON	And you're right.	/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/society;/society/sex;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/law, govt and politics/politics;/society/gay life
223	CLINTON	I don't want to rip families apart.	/family and parenting;/family and parenting/children;/society/social institution/divorce
224	CLINTON	I don't want to be sending parents away from children.	/family and parenting/children
225	CLINTON	I don't want to see the deportation force that Donald has talked about in action in our country.	/law, govt and politics/immigration;/religion and spirituality/judaism;/society/crime/personal offense;/society/unrest and war;/society/crime/personal offense/assault;/travel/transports
226	CLINTON	We have 11 million undocumented people.	/law, govt and politics/immigration;/finance/grants, scholarships and financial aid;/finance/grants, scholarships and financial aid/financial aid;/finance/investing/funds;/business and industrial/company
227	CLINTON	They have 4 million American citizen children, 15 million people.	/family and parenting/children
228	CLINTON	He said as recently as a few weeks ago in Phoenix that every undocumented person would be subject to deportation.	/law, govt and politics/immigration;/society/crime/personal offense
229	CLINTON	Now, here's what that means.	/law, govt and politics/politics;/business and industrial/business operations/management/business process;/religion and spirituality/hinduism;/family and parenting/children;/society;/technology and computing/internet technology/web search/people search;/style and fashion/body art;/society/senior living;/technology and computing/enterprise technology;/society/unrest and war
230	CLINTON	It means you would have to have a massive law enforcement presence, where law enforcement officers would be going school to school, home to home, business to business, rounding up people who are undocumented.	/law, govt and politics/law enforcement;/business and industrial;/education/school;/business and industrial/business operations/management/business process
231	CLINTON	And we would then have to put them on trains, on buses to get them out of our country.	/automotive and vehicles/road-side assistance;/automotive and vehicles/cars;/business and industrial/construction;/automotive and vehicles/cars/hybrid;/travel/business travel;/sports/running and jogging;/automotive and vehicles/cars/performance vehicles;/automotive and vehicles/cars/diesel;/automotive and vehicles/electric vehicles;/automotive and vehicles/commercial vehicles
232	CLINTON	I think that is an idea that is not in keeping with who we are as a nation.	/law, govt and politics/politics;/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/government;/religion and spirituality;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/law, govt and politics/politics/foreign policy
233	CLINTON	I think it's an idea that would rip our country apart.	/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/politics;/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/law, govt and politics/immigration;/religion and spirituality;/society/work/unemployment;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/style and fashion
234	CLINTON	I have been for border security for years.	/law, govt and politics/immigration;/law, govt and politics/law enforcement;/society/crime/drug trafficking
235	CLINTON	I voted for border security in the United States Senate.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections;/law, govt and politics/immigration;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections;/law, govt and politics/law enforcement
236	CLINTON	And my comprehensive immigration reform plan of course includes border security.	/law, govt and politics/immigration;/law, govt and politics/government
237	CLINTON	But I want to put our resources where I think they're most needed: Getting rid of any violent person.	/education/teaching and classroom resources
238	CLINTON	Anybody who should be deported, we should deport them.	/law, govt and politics/immigration;/religion and spirituality/judaism;/society/racism
239	CLINTON	When it comes to the wall that Donald talks about building, he went to Mexico, he had a meeting with the Mexican president.	/law, govt and politics;/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/government/heads of state;/law, govt and politics/immigration;/education/teaching and classroom resources;/business and industrial/construction;/education/teaching and classroom resources/school supplies;/law, govt and politics/politics
240	CLINTON	Didn't even raise it.	/finance/investing/funds;/real estate/buying and selling homes;/society/work;/finance/financial news;/finance/investing/beginning investing;/society/work/unemployment;/finance/bank;/law, govt and politics;/finance/grants, scholarships and financial aid;/education/special education
241	CLINTON	He choked and then got into a Twitter war because the Mexican president said we're not paying for that wall.	/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/immigration;/finance/financial news;/education/teaching and classroom resources;/law, govt and politics/government
242	CLINTON	So I think we are both a nation of immigrants and we are a nation of laws and that we can act accordingly.	/law, govt and politics/immigration;/law, govt and politics/government
243	CLINTON	And that's why I'm introducing comprehensive immigration reform within the first 100 days with the path to citizenship.	/law, govt and politics/immigration
244	WALLACE	Thank you, Secretary Clinton.	/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections

256	TRUMP	Hillary Clinton fought for the wall in 2006 or thereabouts.	/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections
257	TRUMP	Now, she never gets anything done, so naturally the wall wasn't built.	/society/dating;/sports/go kart;/family and parenting/babies and toddlers/baby clothes;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/business and industrial/construction;/style and fashion/body art;/family and parenting/parenting teens;/family and parenting/children;/food and drink;/society/senior living

265	WALLACE	I'd like to hear -- I'd like to hear from Secretary Clinton.	/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections;/law, govt and politics/government
266	CLINTON	I voted for border security, and there are...	/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/immigration;/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections;/law, govt and politics/law enforcement;/law, govt and politics/politics/domestic policy
267	TRUMP	And the wall.	/education/teaching and classroom resources;/education/school;/home and garden/bed and bath/bedroom;/education/teaching and classroom resources/school supplies
268	CLINTON	There are some limited places where that was appropriate.	/education/teaching and classroom resources;/family and parenting/children;/law, govt and politics;/education/studying business;/business and industrial/business operations/management/business process;/education/homework and study tips;/finance/financial news;/health and fitness;/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/automotive and vehicles/vehicle brands
269	CLINTON	There also is necessarily going to be new technology and how best to deploy that.	/technology and computing/internet technology;/technology and computing/enterprise technology;/business and industrial/business operations
270	CLINTON	But it is clear, when you look at what Donald has been proposing, he started his campaign bashing immigrants, calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals and drug dealers, that he has a very different view about what we should do to deal with immigrants.	/law, govt and politics/immigration;/society/crime/sexual offence/rape
271	CLINTON	Now, what I am also arguing is that bringing undocumented immigrants out from the shadows, putting them into the formal economy will be good, because then employers can't exploit them and undercut Americans' wages.	/society/work;/society/work/unemployment;/law, govt and politics/immigration;/society/welfare/healthcare;/law, govt and politics/politics

274	CLINTON	He underpaid undocumented workers, and when they complained, he basically said what a lot of employers do: "You complain, I'll get you deported."	/society/work;/law, govt and politics/immigration;/society/work/unions
275	CLINTON	I want to get everybody out of the shadows, get the economy working, and not let employers like Donald exploit undocumented workers, which hurts them, but also hurts American workers.	/society/work;/society/work/unemployment
276	WALLACE	Mr. Trump?

322	CLINTON	Then they have given that information to WikiLeaks for the purpose of putting it on the Internet.	/technology and computing/internet technology;/technology and computing/internet technology/internet cafes
323	CLINTON	This has come from the highest levels of the Russian government, clearly, from Putin himself, in an effort, as 17 of our intelligence agencies have confirmed, to influence our election.	/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections;/law, govt and politics/espionage and intelligence/terrorism;/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections;/law, govt and politics/politics/foreign policy;/law, govt and politics/politics/political parties;/technology and computing/computer crime;/law, govt and politics/government/heads of state
324	CLINTON	So I actually think the most important question of this evening, Chris, is, finally, will Donald Trump admit and condemn that the Russians are doing this and make it clear that he will not have the help of Putin in in this election, that he rejects Russian espionage against Americans, which he actually encouraged in the past?	/law, govt and politics/espionage and intelligence

458	WALLACE	You also have very different ideas about how to get the economy growing faster.	/society/work/unemployment;/law, govt and politics/politics;/business and industrial/agriculture and forestry/agriculture
459	WALLACE	Secretary Clinton, in your plan, government plays a big role.	/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections;/art and entertainment/theatre;/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/law, govt and politics/politics/foreign policy;/law, govt and politics/armed forces
460	WALLACE	You see more government spending, more entitlements, more tax credits, more tax penalties.	/society/welfare/healthcare;/society/work/unemployment;/real estate/buying and selling homes
461	WALLACE	Mr. Trump, you want to get government out with lower taxes and less regulation.	/society/welfare/healthcare;/society/work/unemployment;/finance/financial news

465	WALLACE	In this round, you go first, Secretary Clinton.	/sports/go kart;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections
466	CLINTON	Well, I think when the middle class thrives, America thrives.	/law, govt and politics/politics;/society/work/unemployment;/society/unrest and war;/family and parenting;/law, govt and politics/immigration;/society/racism;/style and fashion;/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/politics/foreign policy;/art and entertainment/shows and events
467	CLINTON	And so my plan is based on growing the economy, giving middle-class families many more opportunities.	/society/work/unemployment;/law, govt and politics/politics
468	CLINTON	I want us to have the biggest jobs program since World War II, jobs in infrastructure and advanced manufacturing.	/business and industrial/manufacturing

470	CLINTON	New jobs and clean energy, not only to fight climate change, which is a serious problem, but to create new opportunities and new businesses.	/business and industrial/energy/renewable energy;/business and industrial/green solutions
471	CLINTON	I want us to do more to help small business.	/business and industrial;/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/finance/financial news;/business and industrial/business news;/business and industrial/logistics;/business and industrial/business software
472	CLINTON	That's where two- thirds of the new jobs are going to come from.	/society/work/unemployment;/education/homework and study tips;/careers/job search
473	CLINTON	I want us to raise the national minimum wage, because people who live in poverty should not -- who work full-time should not still be in poverty.	/society/work/unemployment;/society/welfare;/society/welfare/healthcare;/family and parenting/children
474	CLINTON	And I sure do want to make sure women get equal pay for the work we do.	/health and fitness/women's health;/society/social institution/divorce;/society/sex;/family and parenting;/family and parenting/motherhood
475	CLINTON	I feel strongly that we have to have an education system that starts with preschool and goes through college.	/family and parenting/children/daycare and preschool
476	CLINTON	That's why I want more technical education in high schools and in community colleges, real apprenticeships to prepare young people for the jobs of the future.	/education/high school;/education/special education;/education/studying business
477	CLINTON	I want to make college debt-free and for families making less than $125,000, you will not get a tuition bill from a public college or university if the plan that I worked on with Bernie Sanders is enacted.	/finance/grants, scholarships and financial aid;/finance/grants, scholarships and financial aid/financial aid;/law, govt and politics/government;/education;/education/school/private school;/education/studying business;/finance/grants, scholarships and financial aid/scholarships;/education/alumni and reunions

479	CLINTON	Most of the gains in the last years since the Great Recession have gone to the very top.	/society/work/unemployment;/finance/bank;/real estate/buying and selling homes;/finance/investing;/finance/investing/beginning investing;/finance/financial news;/finance/investing/funds/mutual funds
480	CLINTON	So we are going to have the wealthy pay their fair share.	/society/work;/real estate/buying and selling homes;/finance/financial news;/society/work/unemployment;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/finance/investing/funds;/society/work/retirement;/finance/investing/options;/finance/investing/beginning investing;/business and industrial

482	CLINTON	That is a plan that has been analyzed by independent experts which said that it could produce 10 million new jobs.	/society/work/unemployment;/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/education/homework and study tips;/law, govt and politics;/business and industrial/construction;/careers/career planning;/finance/investing/funds;/business and industrial/business operations/management/business process;/finance/financial news
483	CLINTON	By contrast, Donald's plan has been analyzed to conclude it might lose 3.5 million jobs.	/society/work/unemployment;/education/homework and study tips;/law, govt and politics;/society/unrest and war
484	CLINTON	Why?	
485	CLINTON	Because his whole plan is to cut taxes, to give the biggest tax breaks ever to the wealthy and to corporations, adding $20 trillion to our debt, and causing the kind of dislocation that we have seen before, because it truly will be trickle-down economics on steroids.	/business and industrial/company/earnings;/finance/bank;/society/work/unemployment;/finance/investing;/finance/investing/beginning investing;/finance/financial news;/finance/investing/funds;/real estate/buying and selling homes;/finance/investing/funds/mutual funds;/business and industrial/company/bankruptcy

1199	TRUMP	And we're bringing GDP from, really, 1 percent, which is what it is now, and if she got in, it will be less than zero.	/society/work/unemployment;/finance/investing;/finance/investing/beginning investing;/finance/investing/funds
1200	TRUMP	But we're bringing it from 1 percent up to 4 percent.	/education/special education;/finance/grants, scholarships and financial aid/government grants;/finance/investing/funds;/education/high school;/society/work/unemployment

1203	TRUMP	And if we do, you don't have to bother asking your question, because we have a tremendous machine.	/technology and computing/hardware/computer;/technology and computing/hardware/computer peripherals;/technology and computing/hardware/computer/portable computer;/technology and computing/hardware/computer components;/technology and computing/hardware/computer peripherals/computer monitors;/law, govt and politics

1205	TRUMP	To do that, we're taking back jobs.	/society/work/unemployment;/education/homework and study tips

1224	WALLACE	Secretary Clinton?	/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections
1225	CLINTON	Well, first, when I hear Donald talk like that and know that his slogan is "Make America Great Again," I wonder when he thought America was great.	/business and industrial/advertising and marketing/advertising;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/law, govt and politics/immigration;/society/racism;/law, govt and politics/commentary;/family and parenting/children;/art and entertainment/shows and events/sports event;/real estate;/real estate/buying and selling homes;/business and industrial/business news
1226	CLINTON	And before he rushes and says, "You know, before you and President Obama were there," I think it's important to recognize that he has been criticizing our government for decades.	/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/politics/foreign policy;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/society/unrest and war;/society/social institution/divorce;/society/work;/society/gay life;/law, govt and politics/politics/lobbying
1227	CLINTON	You know, back in 1987, he took out a $100,000 ad in the New York Times, during the time when President Reagan was president, and basically said exactly what he just said now, that we were the laughingstock of the world.	/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/heads of state;/law, govt and politics/politics/foreign policy;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections;/business and industrial/advertising and marketing/advertising;/law, govt and politics/government/executive branch
1228	CLINTON	He was criticizing President Reagan.	/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/law, govt and politics/politics/foreign policy;/law, govt and politics/politics/domestic policy
1229	CLINTON	This is the way Donald thinks about himself, puts himself into, you know, the middle and says, "You know, I alone can fix it," as he said on the convention stage.	/family and parenting/children;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/family and parenting/babies and toddlers/baby clothes;/society;/society/dating;/news;/food and drink;/style and fashion/body art;/law, govt and politics/government;/family and parenting/parenting teens
1230	CLINTON	But if you look at the debt, which is the issue you asked about, Chris, I pay for everything I'm proposing.	/real estate/buying and selling homes;/finance/financial news;/finance/investing/funds;/society/work/unemployment;/finance/investing/beginning investing;/finance/bank;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/finance/bank/checks;/business and industrial/business news
1231	CLINTON	I do not add a penny to the national debt.	/news/national news
1232	CLINTON	I take that very seriously, because I do think it's one of the issues we've got to come to grips with.	/art and entertainment/comics and animation/comics;/law, govt and politics;/society;/law, govt and politics/politics;/health and fitness/sexuality
1233	CLINTON	So when I talk about how we're going to pay for education, how we're going to invest in infrastructure, how we're going to get the cost of prescription drugs down, and a lot of the other issues that people talk to me about all the time, I've made it very clear we are going where the money is.	/health and fitness/drugs
1234	CLINTON	We are going to ask the wealthy and corporations to pay their fair share.	/business and industrial/company/earnings;/society/work;/finance/financial news;/real estate/buying and selling homes;/finance/investing;/finance/investing/beginning investing;/law, govt and politics;/society/work/unemployment;/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/finance/investing/funds
1235	CLINTON	And there is no evidence whatsoever that that will slow down or diminish our growth.	/society/work/unemployment;/health and fitness;/finance/investing;/finance/investing/beginning investing;/business and industrial/manufacturing;/law, govt and politics;/business and industrial/paper industry;/society/crime/personal offense/homicide;/health and fitness/exercise;/business and industrial/war industry
1236	CLINTON	In fact, I think just the opposite.	/art and entertainment/movies and tv/action;/art and entertainment/movies and tv/romantic comedies;/art and entertainment/movies and tv/movies/reviews;/art and entertainment/movies and tv/bollywood;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/family and parenting/parenting teens;/law, govt and politics;/art and entertainment/movies and tv/comedies;/society/teens;/society/unrest and war

1238	CLINTON	We've got to get back to rebuilding the middle class, the families of America.	/family and parenting;/family and parenting/children

1241	CLINTON	I want to invest in your family.	/finance/investing;/finance/investing/beginning investing
1242	CLINTON	And I think that's the smartest way to grow the economy, to make the economy fairer.	/society/work/unemployment;/law, govt and politics/politics;/business and industrial/agriculture and forestry/agriculture
1243	CLINTON	And we just have a big disagreement about this.	/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/politics;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/law, govt and politics/government/heads of state;/society/work;/sports/basketball;/law, govt and politics/government/parliament;/family and parenting;/sports/hunting and shooting;/health and fitness/men's health

1253	WALLACE	Well, no, sir, because we're running out of time...	/sports/running and jogging

1262	WALLACE	The one last area I want to get into with you in this debate is the fact that the biggest driver of our debt is entitlements, which is 60 percent of all federal spending.	/society/work/unemployment;/finance/investing/funds;/law, govt and politics/government;/automotive and vehicles/auto parts;/finance/bank;/finance/investing/beginning investing;/finance/financial news;/real estate/buying and selling homes;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/education/special education
1263	WALLACE	Now, the Committee for federal -- a Responsible Federal Budget has looked at both of your plans and they say neither of you has a serious plan that is going to solve the fact that Medicare's going to run out of money in the 2020s, Social Security is going to run out of money in the 2030s, and at that time, recipients are going to take huge cuts in their benefits.	/society/welfare/healthcare
1264	WALLACE	So, in effect, the final question I want to ask you in this regard is -- and let me start with you, Mr. Trump, would President Trump make a deal to save Medicare and Social Security that included both tax increases and benefit cuts, in effect, a grand bargain on entitlements?	/society/welfare/healthcare
1265	TRUMP	I'm cutting taxes.	/society/welfare/healthcare;/society/work/unemployment;/finance/investing/funds;/real estate/buying and selling homes;/finance/financial news;/finance/investing/beginning investing;/law, govt and politics/government;/style and fashion/luxury goods;/finance/bank

1270	TRUMP	And one thing we have to do: Repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.	/law, govt and politics/government;/science;/health and fitness/drugs;/science/weather
1271	TRUMP	It's destroying our country.	/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/politics;/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/travel/transports;/law, govt and politics/immigration;/travel/transports/sea travel
1272	TRUMP	It's destroying our businesses, our small business and our big businesses.	/business and industrial;/business and industrial/business operations;/travel/business travel;/business and industrial/business news;/finance/financial news;/business and industrial/business operations/business plans
1273	TRUMP	We have to repeal and replace Obamacare.	/law, govt and politics/government;/health and fitness/drugs
1274	TRUMP	You take a look at the kind of numbers that that will cost us in the year '17, it is a disaster.	/science;/science/weather;/business and industrial/energy/electricity
1275	TRUMP	If we don't repeal and replace -- now, it's probably going to die of its own weight.	/health and fitness/weight loss;/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/parliament;/society/gay life;/society/dating;/automotive and vehicles/vehicle brands;/law, govt and politics/government/legislative;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement
1276	TRUMP	But Obamacare has to go.	/health and fitness/drugs;/law, govt and politics/government;/family and parenting/eldercare
1277	TRUMP	It's -- the premiums are going up 60 percent, 70 percent, 80 percent.	/education/special education;/finance/investing/funds;/finance/grants, scholarships and financial aid/government grants;/education/high school;/health and fitness/drugs;/finance/investing/beginning investing;/society/work;/society/work/unemployment;/real estate/buying and selling homes;/education/homework and study tips
1278	TRUMP	Next year they're going to go up over 100 percent.	/education/special education;/education/high school
1279	TRUMP	And I'm really glad that the premiums have started -- at least the people see what's happening, because she wants to keep Obamacare and she wants to make it even worse, and it can't get any worse.	/health and fitness/drugs;/law, govt and politics/government;/family and parenting/eldercare;/health and fitness/dental care;/health and fitness/men's health
1280	TRUMP	Bad health care at the most expensive price.	/health and fitness/men's health;/health and fitness/drugs;/health and fitness/dental care;/family and parenting/eldercare;/finance/investing/day trading
1281	TRUMP	We have to repeal and replace Obamacare.	/law, govt and politics/government;/health and fitness/drugs
1282	WALLACE	And, Secretary Clinton, same question, because at this point, Social Security and Medicare are going to run out, the trust funds are going to run out of money.	/society/welfare/healthcare;/finance/investing/funds
1283	WALLACE	Will you as president entertain -- will you consider a grand bargain, a deal that includes both tax increases and benefit cuts to try to save both programs?	/society/welfare/healthcare;/society/work;/society/work/unemployment
1284	CLINTON	Well, Chris, I am on record as saying that we need to put more money into the Social Security Trust Fund.	/finance/investing/funds;/finance/grants, scholarships and financial aid/government grants;/society/welfare/healthcare;/society/work
1285	CLINTON	That's part of my commitment to raise taxes on the wealthy.	/education/special education
1286	CLINTON	My Social Security payroll contribution will go up, as will Donald's, assuming he can't figure out how to get out of it.	/science/mathematics/algebra;/society/welfare/healthcare;/society/work/retirement;/society/work/unemployment;/science/biology
1287	CLINTON	But what we want to do is to replenish the Social Security Trust Fund...	/education/special education;/finance/grants, scholarships and financial aid/government grants;/society/welfare/healthcare;/education/high school

1289	CLINTON	by making sure that we have sufficient resources, and that will come from either raising the cap and/or finding other ways to get more money into it.	/education/teaching and classroom resources
1290	CLINTON	I will not cut benefits.	/society/welfare/healthcare;/society/work;/society/work/unemployment;/society/work/retirement;/health and fitness;/finance/investing/funds

1292	CLINTON	But what Donald is proposing with these massive tax cuts will result in a $20 trillion additional national debt.	/finance/bank;/society/work/unemployment;/finance/investing;/finance/investing/beginning investing;/finance/financial news;/finance/investing/funds;/finance/investing/funds/mutual funds
1293	CLINTON	That will have dire consequences for Social Security and Medicare.	/society/welfare/healthcare
1294	CLINTON	And I'll say something about the Affordable Care Act, which he wants to repeal.	/law, govt and politics/government;/health and fitness/drugs;/health and fitness/men's health
1295	CLINTON	The Affordable Care Act extended the solvency of the Medicare Trust Fund.	/health and fitness/drugs;/law, govt and politics/government;/family and parenting/eldercare;/health and fitness/men's health
