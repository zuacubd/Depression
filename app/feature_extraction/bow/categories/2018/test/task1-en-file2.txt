140	BASH	This is the second time in two years those banks neglected to come up with credible plans.	/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/finance/bank
141	BASH	So, as president, would you call on regulators to start the process of breaking up these banks?	/finance/bank;/finance/financial news

147	CLINTON	I'm glad that Senator Sanders is now joining in talking about Dodd-Frank, because Dodd-Frank sets forth the approach that needs to be taken.	/finance/investing/futures trading;/finance/bank
148	CLINTON	I believe, and I will appoint regulators who are tough enough and ready enough to break up any bank that fails the test under Dodd-Frank.	/finance/investing/futures trading;/finance/bank
149	CLINTON	There are two sections there.	/travel/transports/road travel;/business and industrial/construction
150	CLINTON	If they fail either one, that they're a systemic risk, a grave risk to our economy, or if they fail the other, that their living wills, which is what you're referring to, is inadequate.	/finance/financial news;/finance/bank;/finance/investing/futures trading;/finance/investing/beginning investing;/finance/investing/funds/hedge fund;/society/work/unemployment

160	BASH	Senator Sanders, you were recently asked what you would replace the big Wall Street banks with if you could break them up.	/finance/bank;/law, govt and politics/government;/finance/financial news
161	BASH	You said, quote, "That's their decision."	/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/society
162	BASH	Why would you trust the banks to restructure themselves?	/finance/bank;/finance/financial news
163	SANDERS	First, Dana...	
164	BASH	when you said the whole business model was fraudulent?	/real estate/buying and selling homes;/finance/financial news;/business and industrial/company/earnings;/business and industrial/company/bankruptcy;/law, govt and politics;/business and industrial/business software;/finance/investing;/finance/investing/beginning investing;/business and industrial/business news;/finance/investing/funds

168	SANDERS	What Goldman Sachs acknowledged was, essentially, that they were selling fraudulent packages of subprime mortgage loans.	/finance/bank;/real estate/buying and selling homes;/finance/financial news;/finance/investing;/finance/investing/beginning investing;/finance/investing/funds;/finance/investing/funds/hedge fund;/business and industrial/company/earnings
169	SANDERS	Goldman Sachs was not the only bank, other banks, of course, did the same.	/finance/bank
170	SANDERS	Now, I don't need Dodd-Frank now to tell me that we have got to break up these banks, A, because they're based on fraudulent principles, and B, because when you have six financial institutions that have assets equivalent to 58% of the GFP of this country, they are just too big, too much concentration of wealth and power.	/finance/bank;/finance/investing/futures trading;/finance/financial news;/finance/investing/funds
171	BASH	But, Senator...	/law, govt and politics/government
172	SANDERS	The point is we have got to break them up so that they do not pose a systemic risk and so that we have a vibrant economy with a competitive financial system.	/finance/financial news;/finance/bank
173	BASH	But Senator, you didn't answer the specific question which is not just about breaking up the banks, but why allow the banks to do it themselves?	/finance/bank;/law, govt and politics/government
174	SANDERS	Because I'm not sure that the government should say is you are too big to fail.	/finance/bank;/finance/financial news

182	CLINTON	Dana, let me add here that there are two ways to at this under Dodd-Frank, which is after all the law we passed under President Obama, and I'm proud that Barney Frank, one of the authors, has endorsed me because what I have said continuously is, yes, sometimes the government may have to order certain actions.	/finance/investing/futures trading;/finance/bank;/law, govt and politics/government;/finance/financial news
183	CLINTON	Sometime the government can permit the institution themselves to take those actions.	/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/politics

193	BASH	Can you name one decision that she made as senator that shows that he favored banks because of the money she received?	/finance/bank;/law, govt and politics/government;/finance/financial news;/finance/investing/funds
194	SANDERS	Sure.	
195	SANDERS	Sure.	
196	SANDERS	The obvious decision is when the greed and recklessness and illegal behavior of wall street brought this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession -- the Great Depression of the '30s, when millions of people lost their jobs, and their homes, and their life savings, the obvious response to that is that you've got a bunch of fraudulent operators and that they have got to be broken up.	/society/work/unemployment;/society/crime/property crime/fraud;/finance/bank;/finance/financial news;/finance/investing;/finance/investing/beginning investing;/real estate/buying and selling homes;/law, govt and politics

353	CLINTON	And so I think it is important that we do more on manufacturing.	/business and industrial/manufacturing
354	CLINTON	I went to Syracuse and laid out a $10 billion plan that would, I believe, really jump-start advanced manufacturing.	/business and industrial/manufacturing

531	BLITZER	Secretary Clinton, I want you to respond to that, but why did you put out that statement blaming Vermont and its gun policy for some of the death of -- by guns in New York?	/society/crime/personal offense/assault;/travel/transports;/law, govt and politics;/travel/transports/sea travel;/sports/hunting and shooting;/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/armed forces/navy;/sports/hunting and shooting/target shooting;/society/crime/personal offense/homicide
532	CLINTON	Well, the facts are that most of the guns that end up committing crimes in New York come from out of state.	/society/crime;/society/crime/personal offense/assault;/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/law enforcement
533	CLINTON	They come from the states that don't have kind of serious efforts to control guns that we do in New York.	/law, govt and politics;/society/crime/personal offense/assault;/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/armed forces/navy;/law, govt and politics/law enforcement;/business and industrial/business operations;/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/politics;/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/family and parenting/children
534	CLINTON	But let me say this -- in 1988, as we've heard on every debate occasion, Senator Sanders did run for the Congress and he lost.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections
535	CLINTON	He came back in 1990 and he won, and during that campaign he made a commitment to the NRA that he would be against waiting periods.	/sports/hunting and shooting;/sports/hunting and shooting/target shooting;/law, govt and politics/politics/lobbying;/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections;/society/work;/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/law, govt and politics/politics/foreign policy;/business and industrial/business operations
536	CLINTON	And, in fact, in his own book, he talks about his 1990 campaign, and here's what he said.	/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections;/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/law, govt and politics/government/heads of state;/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/law, govt and politics/politics/political parties;/law, govt and politics/politics/lobbying
537	CLINTON	He clearly was helped by the NRA, because they ran ads against his opponent.	/business and industrial/advertising and marketing/advertising;/sports/hunting and shooting
538	CLINTON	So, then he went to the Congress, where he has been a largely very reliable supporter of the NRA.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/executive branch;/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/government/legislative;/law, govt and politics/politics

543	BLITZER	You recently said you do not think crime victims should be able to sue gun makers for damages.	/society/crime
544	BLITZER	The daughter of the Sandy Hook Elementary School who was killed back in the 2012 mass shooting, says you owe her and families an apology.	/law, govt and politics/armed forces/veterans;/society/crime/personal offense/homicide;/society/crime/personal offense/assault;/family and parenting/children;/law, govt and politics/law enforcement;/law, govt and politics/government;/society/crime/personal offense/hate crime;/family and parenting/children/daycare and preschool;/family and parenting/parenting teens;/society/crime/sexual offence/paedophilia
545	BLITZER	Do you?	
546	SANDERS	What we need to do is to do everything that we can to make certain that guns do not fall into the hands of people who do not have them.	/law, govt and politics;/society/unrest and war;/business and industrial/war industry;/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/family and parenting/children;/business and industrial/business operations/management/business process;/health and fitness;/law, govt and politics/politics;/business and industrial/war industry/weaponry;/technology and computing/internet technology
547	SANDERS	Now, I voted against this gun liability law because I was concerned that in rural areas all over this country, if a gun shop owner sells a weapon legally to somebody, and that person then goes out and kills somebody, I don't believe it is appropriate that that gun shop owner who just sold a legal weapon to be held accountable and be sued.	/law, govt and politics;/society/crime/personal offense;/society/crime/property crime;/society/crime/personal offense/homicide;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/law, govt and politics/law enforcement;/society/social institution/divorce;/business and industrial/war industry/weaponry;/family and parenting/children;/society/crime/property crime/fraud

549	SANDERS	They want thousands of rounds of ammunition, or they want a whole lot of guns, yes, that gun shop owner or that gun manufacturer should be held liable.	/sports/hunting and shooting;/society/crime/personal offense/assault;/sports/hunting and shooting/target shooting;/law, govt and politics;/society/crime/personal offense/homicide;/business and industrial/war industry/weaponry;/automotive and vehicles/vehicle brands;/law, govt and politics/law enforcement;/society/unrest and war;/society/crime/property crime/robbery

554	CLINTON	Well, I believe that the law that Senator Sanders voted for that I voted against, giving this special protection to gun manufacturers and to dealers, is an absolute abdication of responsibility on the part of those who voted for it.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections;/automotive and vehicles
555	CLINTON	This is a -- this is a unique gift given to only one industry in the world by the United States Congress, as Senator Murphy from Connecticut said, we have tougher standards holding toy gun manufacturers and sellers to account than we do for real guns.	/shopping/toys
556	CLINTON	And the point that Senator Sanders keeps making about how he wouldn't want a mom and pop store -- that was not the point of this.	/shopping/retail/outlet stores

567	LOUIS	Secretary Clinton, the 1994 crime bill that you supported added 100,000 police officers across the country and banned certain assault weapons.	/society/crime
568	LOUIS	It also imposed tougher prison sentences and eliminated federal funding for inmate education.	/education/special education;/finance/grants, scholarships and financial aid/government grants

571	CLINTON	And you mentioned some of them.	/society/dating;/religion and spirituality/hinduism;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/travel/traveling with kids;/religion and spirituality/christianity;/pets/large animals
572	CLINTON	The Violence Against Women Act, which has been a very important piece of legislation, in my opinion.	/law, govt and politics/government;/society/crime/sexual offence/rape;/society/sex;/law, govt and politics/government/legislative;/health and fitness/women's health;/law, govt and politics/government/parliament;/society/sex/pornography;/society/crime/sexual offence/prostitution;/society/crime/personal offense;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary

579	CLINTON	So we have a problem.	/business and industrial/business software;/science/computer science/artificial intelligence;/science/computer science/cryptography
580	CLINTON	And the very first speech I gave in this campaign was about what I will do to reform the criminal justice system and end the over-mass incarceration.	/society/crime;/law, govt and politics
581	CLINTON	So I think that if all of us go and look back at where we were, Senator Sanders voted for the crime bill, and he says the same thing, there were some good things, and things that we have to change and learn from.	/society/crime
582	CLINTON	So that's how I see it.	/family and parenting/children;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/religion and spirituality/christianity/orthodoxy;/family and parenting/babies and toddlers/baby clothes;/society;/society/dating;/style and fashion/body art;/society/sex;/society/senior living;/law, govt and politics/politics

642	LOUIS	Your time's up, Secretary Clinton.	/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections
643	LOUIS	Senator Sanders, I have a question for you related to this.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections
644	LOUIS	So you've said that by the end of your first term as president, the U.S. will no longer lead the world in mass incarceration.	/law, govt and politics;/society/crime;/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/law, govt and politics/government/heads of state;/society/racism;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections;/law, govt and politics/politics/domestic policy;/law, govt and politics/politics/foreign policy;/law, govt and politics/law enforcement

649	SANDERS	In a very divided Congress, and a very divided politics in America, actually the one area where there is some common ground is conservatives understand that it's insane to be spending $80 billion a year locking up 2.2 million people.	/law, govt and politics/government;/society/welfare/healthcare;/society/work/unemployment;/law, govt and politics/politics;/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/government/executive branch;/law, govt and politics/politics/political parties;/law, govt and politics/politics/domestic policy;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/law, govt and politics/government/parliament

659	BLITZER	Let's turn to another critically important issue.	/art and entertainment/comics and animation/comics;/art and entertainment/shows and events
660	BLITZER	Senator, Secretary, the issue of energy and the environment.	/law, govt and politics/government
661	BLITZER	Secretary Clinton, Senator Sanders has said you are in the pocket of the fossil fuel industry.	/business and industrial/energy/renewable energy;/law, govt and politics/government;/business and industrial/energy/electricity;/business and industrial/energy/renewable energy/biofuel;/business and industrial/energy/natural gas;/business and industrial/energy/nuclear power;/business and industrial/green solutions;/business and industrial/energy/renewable energy/wind energy;/business and industrial/energy/renewable energy/geothermal energy

664	CLINTON	Well, let me start by saying we need to talk about this issue and we should talk about it in terms of the extraordinary threats that climate change pose to our country and our world.	/business and industrial/energy/renewable energy;/law, govt and politics;/business and industrial/green solutions;/business and industrial/energy/nuclear power;/society
665	CLINTON	And that's why for the last many years, both in the Senate and as secretary of State, it's been a big part of my commitment to see what could be done.	/law, govt and politics/government
666	CLINTON	But there has never been any doubt that when I was a senator, I tried -- I joined with others to try to get rid of the subsidies for big oil.	/business and industrial/energy/oil
667	CLINTON	And I have proposed that again, because that's what I think needs to be done as we transition from fossil fuels to clean energy.	/science/ecology/pollution;/science/ecology/environmental disaster;/automotive and vehicles/electric vehicles;/finance/investing;/finance/investing/beginning investing
668	CLINTON	And everyone who's looked at this independently, "The Washington Post" and others, who give us both hard times when called for on facts, have said that this is absolutely an incorrect false charge.	/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/society/crime/sexual offence;/society/crime/personal offense;/law, govt and politics/government;/society/crime/personal offense/torture;/business and industrial/business news;/law, govt and politics/government/executive branch;/news/national news;/society/crime/property crime/fraud
669	CLINTON	So, we both have relatively small amounts of contributions from people who work for fossil fuel companies.	/business and industrial/energy/renewable energy;/business and industrial/energy/electricity;/business and industrial/energy/natural gas;/business and industrial/green solutions;/business and industrial/energy/renewable energy/biofuel;/business and industrial/energy/nuclear power;/finance/investing;/finance/investing/beginning investing;/business and industrial/energy/renewable energy/solar energy
670	CLINTON	Best we can tell from the reports that are done.	/news
671	CLINTON	But, that is not being supported by big oil, and I think it's important to distinguish that.	/business and industrial/energy/oil
672	CLINTON	And, let's talk about what each of us has proposed to try to combat greenhouse gas emissions and put us on the fastest track possible to clean energy.	/business and industrial/energy/renewable energy;/business and industrial/energy/renewable energy/biofuel;/business and industrial/energy/electricity;/business and industrial/green solutions;/business and industrial/energy/natural gas;/automotive and vehicles/cars/hybrid
673	BLITZER	Thank you.	
674	BLITZER	We're going to get to that to, but I want you to respond, Senator.	/law, govt and politics/government
675	SANDERS	It is one thing, as the Secretary indicated, to talk about workers.	/society/work;/society/work/unions
676	SANDERS	I'm sure I have contributions, you have contributions from workers in every industry in the country.	/business and industrial/paper industry;/business and industrial/war industry;/society/work
677	SANDERS	But, as I understand it, 43 lobbyists for the fossil fuel industry maxed out, gave the maximum amount of money to Secretary Clinton's campaign.	/business and industrial/energy/renewable energy;/business and industrial/energy/electricity;/business and industrial/energy/natural gas;/business and industrial/energy/renewable energy/biofuel;/business and industrial/green solutions;/business and industrial/energy/nuclear power;/business and industrial/paper industry;/business and industrial/energy/renewable energy/wind energy;/business and industrial/war industry

696	CLINTON	Well, let's talk about the global environmental crisis.	/science/ecology/environmental disaster
697	CLINTON	Starting in 2009 as your Secretary of State, I worked with President Obama to bring China and India to the table for the very first time, to get a commitment out of them that they would begin to address their own greenhouse gas emissions.	/business and industrial/energy/renewable energy;/business and industrial/energy/renewable energy/biofuel;/business and industrial/energy/electricity;/business and industrial/green solutions;/business and industrial/energy/natural gas;/business and industrial/energy/nuclear power

722	CLINTON	Well, I'm a little bewildered about how to respond when you have an agreement which gives you the framework to actually take the action that would have only come about because under the Obama administration in the face of implacable hostility from the Republicans in Congress, President Obama moved forward on gas mileage, he moved forward on the clean power plant.	/business and industrial/energy/nuclear power;/business and industrial/energy/natural gas;/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/armed forces

739	LOUIS	Fracking, of course, a way of extracting natural gas.	/business and industrial/energy/natural gas
740	LOUIS	Now as a candidate for president, you say that by the time you're done with all your rules and regulations, fracking will be restricted in many places around the country.	/business and industrial/energy/natural gas;/business and industrial/energy/oil/oil and gas prices
741	LOUIS	Why have you changed your view on fracking?	/business and industrial/energy/natural gas;/business and industrial/energy/oil/oil and gas prices
742	CLINTON	No, well, I don't think I've changed my view on what we need to do to go from where we are, where the world is heavily dependent on coal and oil, but principally coal, to where we need to be, which is clean renewable energy, and one of the bridge fuels is natural gas.	/business and industrial/energy/natural gas;/business and industrial/energy/renewable energy;/business and industrial/energy/coal
743	CLINTON	And so for both economic and environmental and strategic reasons, it was American policy to try to help countries get out from under the constant use of coal, building coal plants all the time, also to get out from under, especially if they were in Europe, the pressure from Russia, which has been incredibly intense.	/business and industrial/energy/coal
744	CLINTON	So we did say natural gas is a bridge.	/business and industrial/energy/natural gas
745	CLINTON	We want to cross that bridge as quickly as possible, because in order to deal with climate change, we have got to move as rapidly as we can.	/business and industrial/energy/renewable energy;/business and industrial/green solutions;/business and industrial/construction

749	CLINTON	So I have big, bold goals, but I know in order to get from where we are, where the world is still burning way too much coal, where the world is still too intimidated by countries and providers like Russia, we have got to make a very firm but decisive move in the direction of clean energy.	/business and industrial/energy/coal

763	CLINTON	You know, I have laid out a set of actions that build on what President Obama was able to accomplish, building on the clean power plan, which is currently under attack by fossil fuels and the right in the Supreme Court, which is one of the reasons why we need to get the Supreme Court justice that President Obama has nominated to be confirmed so that we can actually continue to make progress.	/law, govt and politics/government;/business and industrial/energy/renewable energy;/law, govt and politics/government/executive branch;/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary;/business and industrial/green solutions;/business and industrial/energy/natural gas;/business and industrial/energy/coal

818	BLITZER	Secretary Clinton, President Obama says the worst mistake in office that he made over these past seven and a half years was not preparing for Libya after Moammar Qadafi was removed.	/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/law, govt and politics/politics/foreign policy;/law, govt and politics/government;/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/politics/domestic policy

823	CLINTON	We helped them hold two successful elections, something that is not easy, which they did very well because they had a pent up desire to try to chart their own future after 42 years of dictatorship.	/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections;/law, govt and politics/politics/political parties;/society/unrest and war

826	CLINTON	We also worked to help them set up their government.	/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/law, govt and politics/government/parliament

902	SANDERS	Second of all, I know you keep referring to Barack Obama all night here, but you in Syria, you in Syria talked about a no-fly zone, which the president certainly does not support, nor do I support because, A, it will cost an enormous sum of money, second of all, it runs the risk of getting us sucked into perpetual warfare in that region.	/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/business and industrial/business operations;/law, govt and politics/armed forces/air force;/law, govt and politics/politics/foreign policy
903	SANDERS	Thirdly, when we talk about Syria right now, no debate, like Gadhafi, like Saddam Hussein, Assad is another brutal murdering dictator, but right now our fight is to destroy ISIS first, and to get rid of Assad second.	/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/society/unrest and war;/religion and spirituality/islam;/law, govt and politics/government/heads of state;/law, govt and politics/politics/foreign policy;/business and industrial/war industry/weaponry;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement
904	CLINTON	Well, I think Senator Sanders has just reinforced my point.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections
905	CLINTON	Yes, when I was secretary of state I did urge, along with the Department of Defense and the CIA that we seek out, vet, and train, and arm Syrian opposition figures so that they could defend themselves against Assad.	/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/law, govt and politics/espionage and intelligence/terrorism

914	SANDERS	Well, what I believe, if my memory is correct here, we spend about 75 percent of the entire cost of the military aspect of NATO.	/technology and computing/hardware/computer components/memory
915	SANDERS	Given the fact that France has a very good health care system and free public education, college education for their people, the U.K. has a good National Health Service and they also provide fairly reasonable higher education, you know what, yeah, I do believe that the countries of Europe should pick up more of the burden for their defense.	/education;/education/studying business;/health and fitness/men's health;/health and fitness/dental care

932	CLINTON	It has bound together across the Atlantic countries that are democracies, that have many of the same values and interests, and now we need to modernize it and move it into the 21st century to serve as that head of our defense operations in Europe when it comes to terrorism and other threats that we face.	/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/politics;/business and industrial/business operations;/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/politics/foreign policy;/law, govt and politics/law enforcement
