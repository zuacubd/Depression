110	MR.

111	MR.

112	MR. SCHWAB	And my first question is, why is the tax reform — why has it been of such a high priority for your administration?	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/politics/domestic policy;/society/work/unemployment;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/law, govt and politics/government/legislative;/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/government/executive branch;/law, govt and politics/politics/lobbying
113	TRUMP	Well, first of all, Klaus, I want to congratulate you.	/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/society/unrest and war;/family and parenting/children;/law, govt and politics;/sports/go kart;/law, govt and politics/politics;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/society/dating;/family and parenting/parenting teens;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections
114	TRUMP	This is an incredible group of people.	/art and entertainment/comics and animation/comics;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/art and entertainment/comics and animation/anime and manga;/art and entertainment/shows and events/concert;/society/racism;/family and parenting/parenting teens;/art and entertainment/movies;/style and fashion/body art;/society/senior living;/family and parenting/children
115	TRUMP	We had dinner last night with about 15 leaders of industry, none of whom I knew, but all of whom I’ve read about for years.	/business and industrial/war industry;/business and industrial/paper industry
116	TRUMP	And it was truly an incredible group.	/art and entertainment/shows and events/concert;/art and entertainment/movies and tv/movies/reviews;/art and entertainment/comics and animation/anime and manga;/art and entertainment/movies and tv/action;/society/senior living;/style and fashion/body art;/art and entertainment/shows and events/classical concert;/family and parenting;/sports/fencing;/art and entertainment/comics and animation/comics
117	TRUMP	But I think I have 15 new friends.	/family and parenting/parenting teens;/society/dating;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/hobbies and interests/home recording;/society/teens;/family and parenting/babies and toddlers/baby clothes;/hobbies and interests/magic and illusion;/hobbies and interests/getting published;/style and fashion/body art;/family and parenting/children
118	TRUMP	So this has been really great what you’ve done and putting it together, the economic forum.	/family and parenting/babies and toddlers/baby clothes;/society/dating;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/society/unrest and war;/health and fitness/sexuality;/family and parenting/parenting teens;/law, govt and politics/politics;/style and fashion;/family and parenting/children;/society/teens
119	TRUMP	The tax reform was a dream of a lot of people over many years, but they weren’t able to get it done.	/law, govt and politics/government;/society/work/unemployment;/real estate/buying and selling homes;/finance/financial news;/finance/bank;/business and industrial;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/law, govt and politics/government/legislative
120	TRUMP	Many people tried, and Ronald Reagan was really the last to make a meaningful cut and reform.	/law, govt and politics/politics;/society/welfare/healthcare;/society/work/unemployment;/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/government;/education/teaching and classroom resources;/law, govt and politics/politics/foreign policy;/law, govt and politics/politics/domestic policy;/law, govt and politics/politics/political parties;/law, govt and politics/armed forces
121	TRUMP	And ours is cutting and reforming.	/society/welfare/healthcare;/sports/fencing;/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/politics;/society/work/unemployment;/education/teaching and classroom resources/school supplies;/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/law, govt and politics/government/parliament;/law, govt and politics/politics/political parties
122	TRUMP	We emphasize cut, but the reform is probably almost as important.	/law, govt and politics/politics;/society/unrest and war;/society/work/unemployment;/style and fashion;/education/teaching and classroom resources;/education/teaching and classroom resources/school supplies;/society/dating;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/business and industrial/metals;/religion and spirituality/judaism
123	TRUMP	We’ve wanted to do it.	/society/unrest and war;/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/politics
124	TRUMP	It is very tough, politically, to do it.	/law, govt and politics/politics;/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/government
125	TRUMP	Hard to believe that would be, but it is very, very tough.	/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/government;/art and entertainment/movies;/society/crime/personal offense;/society/crime/personal offense/assault;/family and parenting/parenting teens;/society/senior living;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/society/teens
126	TRUMP	That’s why it hasn’t been done in close to 40 years.	/family and parenting/children;/business and industrial/business operations/management/business process;/education/studying business;/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/education/homework and study tips;/education/teaching and classroom resources/school supplies;/law, govt and politics;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/society/senior living;/society/work
127	TRUMP	And once we got it going, it was going.	/sports/go kart;/society/dating;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/family and parenting/babies and toddlers/baby clothes;/family and parenting/parenting teens;/automotive and vehicles/auto parts;/sports/walking;/society/teens;/sports/bowling
128	TRUMP	And the big — and I wouldn’t say a total surprise, but one of the big things that happened and took place is AT&T and some others came out very early and they said they were going to pay thousands and thousands of dollars to people that work for their companies.	/finance/investing/funds;/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/law, govt and politics;/business and industrial/company/earnings;/finance/financial news;/society/unrest and war;/finance/investing/day trading;/finance/investing/beginning investing;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/finance/grants, scholarships and financial aid
129	TRUMP	And you have 300,000, 400,000, 500,000 people working for these companies, and all of a sudden it became like a big waterfall, a big, beautiful waterfall where so many companies are doing it.	/business and industrial/company;/finance/investing;/finance/investing/beginning investing;/business and industrial/company/earnings;/finance/financial news;/business and industrial/war industry;/business and industrial/business operations;/business and industrial/manufacturing;/business and industrial/paper industry;/business and industrial/business operations/management/business process
130	TRUMP	And even today they just announced many more.	/law, govt and politics;/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/politics;/business and industrial/company;/business and industrial/company/merger and acquisition;/law, govt and politics/immigration;/religion and spirituality/judaism;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/automotive and vehicles/auto parts;/religion and spirituality/christianity
131	TRUMP	But every day they announce more and more.	/sports/wrestling;/shopping;/law, govt and politics/government;/shopping/resources/contests and freebies;/travel/traveling with kids;/news;/automotive and vehicles/road-side assistance;/food and drink;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/food and drink/cuisines
132	TRUMP	And now it’s a fight for who’s going to give the most.	/sports/boxing
133	TRUMP	It started at 1,000, and now we have them up to 3,000.	/society/unrest and war;/business and industrial/business operations;/automotive and vehicles/auto parts;/sports/cricket;/automotive and vehicles/cars/car culture;/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/business and industrial/war industry;/automotive and vehicles/cars/hybrid
134	TRUMP	This is something that we didn’t anticipate.	/art and entertainment/shows and events;/style and fashion/body art;/family and parenting/children;/society;/family and parenting/parenting teens;/health and fitness/sexuality;/law, govt and politics;/society/sex;/society/teens;/art and entertainment/movies
135	TRUMP	Oftentimes in business, things happen that you don’t anticipate.	/business and industrial;/business and industrial/business operations/management/business process;/business and industrial/business news;/finance/financial news
136	TRUMP	Usually that’s a bad thing, but this was a good thing.	/food and drink/food;/society;/style and fashion;/society/social institution;/society/social institution/marriage;/family and parenting/children;/society/social institution/divorce;/art and entertainment;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/style and fashion/body art
137	TRUMP	This came out of nowhere.	/automotive and vehicles/cars/coupe;/society/unrest and war;/automotive and vehicles/cars/sedan;/automotive and vehicles/cars/car culture;/automotive and vehicles/cars/convertible;/automotive and vehicles/cars/wagon;/automotive and vehicles/auto parts;/sports/cricket;/automotive and vehicles/cars/performance vehicles;/law, govt and politics/politics
138	TRUMP	Nobody ever thought of this as a possibility even.	/law, govt and politics/politics;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/society/unrest and war;/family and parenting/children;/society/senior living;/religion and spirituality;/religion and spirituality/christianity;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/family and parenting/parenting teens;/style and fashion/body art
139	TRUMP	It wasn’t in the equation.	/business and industrial/business software;/science/physics/electromagnetism;/science/physics/thermodynamics;/business and industrial/energy;/science/mathematics/geometry
140	TRUMP	We waited — we said, wait until February 1st when the checks start coming in.	/business and industrial/business operations;/law, govt and politics;/finance/bank/bank account;/travel/transports/sea travel;/finance/bank/checks;/society/unrest and war;/travel/business travel;/news;/travel/transports/train travel;/finance/financial news
141	TRUMP	And people, Klaus, have a lot more money in their paycheck — because it’s not just a little money, this is a lot of money for people making a living doing whatever they may be doing.	/finance/bank/bank account;/finance/investing/funds;/finance/financial news;/finance/bank/checks;/finance/investing/beginning investing;/business and industrial;/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/society/work;/society/work/unemployment;/family and parenting
142	TRUMP	And we really though February 1st it was going to kick in and everybody was going to be — well, we haven’t even gotten there yet and it’s kicked in.	/art and entertainment/shows and events;/sports/go kart;/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/sports/football;/travel/traveling with kids;/society/dating;/society/senior living;/style and fashion/body art;/family and parenting/parenting teens;/family and parenting/children
143	TRUMP	And it’s had an incredible impact on the stock market and the stock prices.	/finance/investing/stocks;/finance/investing/beginning investing;/finance/investing/day trading;/finance/investing/funds/mutual funds
144	TRUMP	We’ve set 84 records since my election — record stock market prices, meaning we hit new highs 84 different times out of a one-year period.	/finance/investing/stocks;/finance/investing/day trading;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections;/real estate/buying and selling homes;/finance/investing/beginning investing;/society/work/unemployment;/finance/financial news;/finance/bank;/finance/investing/funds/mutual funds;/law, govt and politics/politics/political parties

146	TRUMP	And in all fairness, that was done before we passed the tax cuts and tax reform.	/society/welfare/healthcare
147	TRUMP	So what happened is really something special.	/art and entertainment/shows and events;/art and entertainment/movies and tv/movies;/family and parenting/parenting teens;/art and entertainment/movies and tv/movies/reviews;/family and parenting/babies and toddlers/baby clothes;/style and fashion/body art;/society;/society/dating;/society/teens;/family and parenting/children
148	TRUMP	Then, as you know, and as I just said, Apple came in with $350 billion.	/technology and computing/operating systems/mac os;/finance/investing;/finance/investing/beginning investing;/technology and computing/hardware/computer components/disks
149	TRUMP	And I tell you, I spoke with Tim Cook; I said, Tim, I will never consider this whole great run that we’ve made complete until you start building plants in the U.S.	/sports/go kart;/law, govt and politics;/society/senior living;/food and drink;/society/unrest and war;/family and parenting/children;/business and industrial/green solutions;/food and drink/cuisines;/business and industrial/energy/electricity;/art and entertainment/shows and events

151	TRUMP	But when I heard 350, I thought he was talking — I thought they were talking $350 million.	/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/family and parenting/children;/law, govt and politics/politics;/society;/business and industrial/company/earnings;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/society/dating;/family and parenting/babies and toddlers;/family and parenting/parenting teens;/business and industrial/company/merger and acquisition
152	TRUMP	And, by the way, that’s a nice-sized plant.	/business and industrial/energy/nuclear power;/business and industrial/energy/nuclear power/nuclear accident;/business and industrial/energy/natural gas;/business and industrial/manufacturing;/business and industrial/energy/coal
153	TRUMP	Not the greatest, but not bad.	/art and entertainment/movies and tv/movies/reviews;/art and entertainment/movies and tv/action;/careers/career planning;/careers/job fairs;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/sports/tennis;/society/unrest and war;/art and entertainment/shows and events/classical concert
154	TRUMP	And they said, “No, sir.

156	TRUMP	Well, we have tremendous amounts of money, including my newfound friends from last night — great companies.	/business and industrial/company;/finance/investing;/finance/investing/beginning investing;/finance/financial news;/business and industrial/company/earnings;/business and industrial/business operations;/business and industrial/business operations/management/business process;/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/business and industrial/war industry;/business and industrial/business news
157	TRUMP	They’re all investing.	/finance/investing;/finance/investing/beginning investing
158	TRUMP	When one of the gentlemen said he’s putting in $2 billion because of the tax cuts, I said to myself, “Wow, he’s actually the cheap one in the group” — because they’re putting in massive numbers of billions of dollars.	/finance/investing;/finance/investing/beginning investing;/society/work/unemployment;/finance/bank;/finance/financial news;/finance/investing/funds;/business and industrial/company/earnings;/real estate/buying and selling homes;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/business and industrial/war industry

160	TRUMP	You have a United States where people from all over the world are looking to come in and invest, and there’s just nothing like what’s happening.	/finance/investing;/finance/investing/beginning investing
161	TRUMP	And I just want to finish by — I have a group of people that have been so — I have a whole lot of them, so I won’t introduce because then I’ll insult at least half of them.	/automotive and vehicles/auto parts;/sports/auto racing/nascar;/automotive and vehicles/cars/car culture;/sports/boat racing;/sports/go kart;/automotive and vehicles/buying and selling cars;/automotive and vehicles/cars/performance vehicles;/society;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/sports/olympics
162	TRUMP	But I’ve had a group of people that worked so hard on this and other things.	/society/social institution/divorce;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/family and parenting/babies and toddlers/baby clothes;/family and parenting/children;/art and entertainment/shows and events/concert;/style and fashion;/style and fashion/body art;/law, govt and politics/politics;/religion and spirituality

165	TRUMP	When you look at all of the different charts and polls, and you see, as an example, African American unemployment at the historic low — it’s never had a period of time like this.	/society/work/unemployment;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections
166	TRUMP	Same with Hispanic.	/law, govt and politics/immigration;/society/crime/personal offense/hate crime;/society/racism

197	TRUMP	I’d buy things that would fail –that would be failures — and I’d turn them around and try and get them for the right price, and then I’d turn them around and make them successful.	/automotive and vehicles/buying and selling cars;/finance/investing/day trading;/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/finance/financial news;/automotive and vehicles/auto parts

200	TRUMP	And, you know, historically, I guess, there’s never really been a businessman or businessperson elected President.	/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections;/society/work;/law, govt and politics/politics/political parties;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/law, govt and politics/government/heads of state;/society/unrest and war;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/real estate/buying and selling homes

202	TRUMP	Throughout history, it’s always been a general — you had to be a general — but mostly it was politicians.	/law, govt and politics;/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/politics;/law, govt and politics/politics/political parties;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement

204	TRUMP	And then, in all fairness, I was saying to Klaus last night: Had the opposing party to me won — some of whom you backed, some of the people in the room — instead of being up almost 50 percent — the stock market is up since my election almost 50 percent — rather than that, I believe the stock market from that level, the initial level, would have been down close to 50 percent.	/finance/investing/stocks;/finance/investing/beginning investing;/law, govt and politics;/finance/investing/funds;/finance/investing/day trading;/society/work/unemployment;/finance/financial news;/real estate/buying and selling homes;/education/special education;/law, govt and politics/politics

210	TRUMP	The other thing is, I’ve always seemed to get, for whatever reason, a disproportionate amount of press or media.	/news/national news;/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/politics;/art and entertainment/movies and tv/television;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/society/work;/law, govt and politics/politics/lobbying;/family and parenting;/family and parenting/parenting teens

215	TRUMP	The numbers speak and things happen, but I’ve always really had a very good press.	/science/mathematics/arithmetic
216	TRUMP	And it wasn’t until I became a politician that I realized how nasty, how mean, how vicious, and how fake the press can be.	/art and entertainment/shows and events;/society/dating;/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/politics;/business and industrial/business news;/news/national news;/style and fashion/body art;/family and parenting/babies and toddlers;/family and parenting/parenting teens;/pets/large animals

222	TRUMP	And I really believe it was time, and it was time to do that job, because I don’t think the United States would have done very well if it went through four or eight more years of regulation and, really, a very anti-business group of people.	/art and entertainment/shows and events;/law, govt and politics;/society;/society/dating;/family and parenting/children;/family and parenting/parenting teens;/society/work;/law, govt and politics/politics;/family and parenting/babies and toddlers;/business and industrial/war industry

225	TRUMP	In one year we’ve cut more regulations in my administration than any other administration in four, eight, or sixteen years, in the one case.	/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/law, govt and politics/government/executive branch;/society/unrest and war;/society/work;/law, govt and politics/government/legislative;/law, govt and politics/politics/domestic policy

230	TRUMP	But we’ve cut more than any administration ever in the history of our country, and we still have a ways to go.	/sports/go kart;/law, govt and politics
231	TRUMP	So I think between that and the tremendous tax cuts, we’ve really done something.	/society/work/unemployment;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections;/law, govt and politics/government;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/society/gay life;/family and parenting/parenting teens;/law, govt and politics/politics/domestic policy;/health and fitness/drugs;/law, govt and politics/politics/lobbying
232	TRUMP	And one other thing I said — and I saw it last night with some of the leaders and the businesspeople — I think I’ve been a cheerleader for our country, and everybody representing a company or a country has to be a cheerleader, or no matter what you do, it’s just not going to work.	/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/politics;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/society/unrest and war;/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/family and parenting/parenting teens;/society/work;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/finance/financial news;/news/national news
