26	HOLT	There are two economic realities in America today.	/law, govt and politics/politics;/society/work/unemployment;/society/unrest and war

31	CLINTON	The central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we'll build together.	/law, govt and politics/politics/elections;/law, govt and politics/politics/political parties;/law, govt and politics/government/parliament
32	CLINTON	Today is my granddaughter's second birthday, so I think about this a lot.	/society/social institution/divorce;/family and parenting/parenting teens
33	CLINTON	First, we have to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top.	/society/work/unemployment;/law, govt and politics/politics
34	CLINTON	That means we need new jobs, good jobs, with rising incomes.	/society/work/unemployment;/education/special education;/education/high school;/finance/grants, scholarships and financial aid/government grants;/finance/investing/funds;/society/welfare/healthcare
35	CLINTON	I want us to invest in you.	/finance/investing;/finance/investing/beginning investing
36	CLINTON	I want us to invest in your future.	/finance/investing;/finance/investing/beginning investing
37	CLINTON	That means jobs in infrastructure, in advanced manufacturing, innovation and technology, clean, renewable energy, and small business, because most of the new jobs will come from small business.	/business and industrial/energy/renewable energy;/business and industrial/manufacturing
38	CLINTON	We also have to make the economy fairer.	/society/work/unemployment;/law, govt and politics/politics;/finance/investing
39	CLINTON	That starts with raising the national minimum wage and also guarantee, finally, equal pay for women's work.	/society/work;/society/work/unemployment;/society/welfare/healthcare;/law, govt and politics
40	CLINTON	I also want to see more companies do profit-sharing.	/business and industrial/company/earnings;/finance/investing;/finance/investing/beginning investing;/finance/accounting and auditing;/finance/financial news;/real estate/buying and selling homes;/society/work
41	CLINTON	If you help create the profits, you should be able to share in them, not just the executives at the top.	/business and industrial/company/earnings
42	CLINTON	And I want us to do more to support people who are struggling to balance family and work.	/business and industrial/business operations;/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics;/finance/financial news;/society/work/unemployment;/family and parenting;/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/business and industrial/logistics;/law, govt and politics/politics

61	TRUMP	They're devaluing their currency, and there's nobody in our government to fight them.	/finance/bank;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/society/work/unemployment;/finance/financial news;/law, govt and politics/politics
62	TRUMP	And we have a very good fight.	/sports/boxing
63	TRUMP	And we have a winning fight.	/sports/boxing
64	TRUMP	Because they're using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild China, and many other countries are doing the same thing.	/art and entertainment/shows and events;/art and entertainment/comics and animation/cartoons;/art and entertainment/movies and tv/animated;/art and entertainment/movies and tv/movies;/family and parenting/babies and toddlers/baby food;/law, govt and politics/politics;/travel/traveling with kids;/society/unrest and war;/art and entertainment/movies and tv/movies/reviews;/automotive and vehicles/buying and selling cars

444	TRUMP	When we have a country that's doing so badly, that's being ripped off by every single country in the world, it's the kind of thinking that our country needs, because everybody -- Lester, we have a trade deficit with all of the countries that we do business with, of almost $800 billion a year.	/society/work/unemployment;/finance/investing;/finance/investing/beginning investing;/law, govt and politics;/finance/financial news

482	HOLT	We did ask you to be silent, so it would be helpful for us.	/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/finance/financial news;/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/health and fitness;/business and industrial/business news;/family and parenting/children;/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/business and industrial/construction
483	HOLT	Secretary Clinton?	/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections
484	CLINTON	Well, I think you've seen another example of bait-and- switch here.	/technology and computing/hardware/computer networking/router;/technology and computing/networking/network monitoring and management;/technology and computing/hardware/computer components;/technology and computing/hardware/computer peripherals;/technology and computing/hardware/computer/portable computer;/news;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/technology and computing/hardware/computer peripherals/computer monitors;/art and entertainment/movies and tv/movies/reviews;/technology and computing/operating systems
485	CLINTON	For 40 years, everyone running for president has released their tax returns.	/law, govt and politics/government;/real estate/buying and selling homes;/business and industrial;/education/studying business;/society/work;/society/work/retirement;/society/dating;/travel/traveling with kids;/society/work/unemployment;/travel/business travel
486	CLINTON	You can go and see nearly, I think, 39, 40 years of our tax returns, but everyone has done it.	/real estate/buying and selling homes;/family and parenting/babies and toddlers/baby clothes;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/family and parenting/children;/society;/society/dating;/family and parenting/parenting teens;/law, govt and politics;/business and industrial;/law, govt and politics/government
487	CLINTON	We know the IRS has made clear there is no prohibition on releasing it when you're under audit.	/finance/accounting and auditing/tax preparation and planning;/finance/investing/funds
488	CLINTON	So you've got to ask yourself, why won't he release his tax returns?	/real estate/buying and selling homes;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/business and industrial;/business and industrial/record company;/law, govt and politics/government;/art and entertainment/shows and events/concert;/business and industrial/business software;/travel/traveling with kids;/family and parenting;/business and industrial/business news
489	CLINTON	And I think there may be a couple of reasons.	/society/social institution;/society/social institution/marriage;/society/social institution/divorce;/family and parenting/children;/society/social institution/marriage/common law marriage;/society/social institution/marriage/weddings;/law, govt and politics;/health and fitness/sexuality;/society/sex
490	CLINTON	First, maybe he's not as rich as he says he is.	/family and parenting/babies and toddlers/baby clothes;/society/dating;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/food and drink;/style and fashion;/style and fashion/body art;/society/sex;/family and parenting/parenting teens;/society/senior living;/law, govt and politics/politics
491	CLINTON	Second, maybe he's not as charitable as he claims to be.	/law, govt and politics;/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/society;/business and industrial/company/earnings;/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/politics/lobbying;/society/welfare;/health and fitness;/business and industrial/company/bankruptcy
492	CLINTON	Third, we don't know all of his business dealings, but we have been told through investigative reporting that he owes about $650 million to Wall Street and foreign banks.	/finance/bank;/finance/financial news
493	CLINTON	Or maybe he doesn't want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes, because the only years that anybody's ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license, and they showed he didn't pay any federal income tax.	/finance/investing/funds;/finance/grants, scholarships and financial aid/government grants;/society/welfare/healthcare;/business and industrial/company/earnings;/real estate/buying and selling homes;/society/work;/society/work/unemployment;/law, govt and politics/government;/finance/financial news
494	TRUMP	That makes me smart.	/technology and computing/consumer electronics/telephones/mobile phones/smart phones;/business and industrial/automation;/technology and computing/internet technology;/technology and computing/enterprise technology;/automotive and vehicles/electric vehicles;/society/dating;/technology and computing/consumer electronics/tv and video equipment/televisions/lcd tvs;/sports/go kart;/business and industrial/business software;/business and industrial/green solutions
495	CLINTON	So if he's paid zero, that means zero for troops, zero for vets, zero for schools or health.	/health and fitness/men's health
496	CLINTON	And I think probably he's not all that enthusiastic about having the rest of our country see what the real reasons are, because it must be something really important, even terrible, that he's trying to hide.	/art and entertainment/shows and events;/society/dating;/family and parenting/children;/law, govt and politics;/society/unrest and war;/family and parenting/babies and toddlers/baby clothes;/law, govt and politics/politics;/family and parenting/parenting teens;/style and fashion/body art;/society/senior living
497	CLINTON	And the financial disclosure statements, they don't give you the tax rate.	/finance/accounting and auditing/tax preparation and planning
498	CLINTON	They don't give you all the details that tax returns would.	/business and industrial/company/earnings;/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/government;/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/finance/investing/funds;/real estate/buying and selling homes;/finance/financial news;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/society/unrest and war;/finance/investing/beginning investing
499	CLINTON	And it just seems to me that this is something that the American people deserve to see.	/art and entertainment/shows and events;/society/dating;/family and parenting/children;/style and fashion/body art;/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/politics;/society/senior living;/society/sex;/law, govt and politics/politics/foreign policy;/family and parenting/parenting teens
500	CLINTON	And I have no reason to believe that he's ever going to release his tax returns, because there's something he's hiding.	/art and entertainment/shows and events;/real estate/buying and selling homes;/society;/law, govt and politics;/travel/traveling with kids;/family and parenting/children;/society/dating;/society/senior living;/family and parenting/parenting teens;/law, govt and politics/government

503	CLINTON	But I think the question is, were he ever to get near the White House, what would be those conflicts?	/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/politics/domestic policy;/law, govt and politics/politics/foreign policy;/law, govt and politics/government/heads of state;/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections;/law, govt and politics/government/executive branch;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement
504	CLINTON	Who does he owe money to?	/finance/bank/bank account;/finance/investing/funds;/finance/financial news;/business and industrial/company/earnings;/real estate/buying and selling homes;/finance/investing/beginning investing;/finance/bank/checks;/education/studying business;/society/work/unemployment;/finance/investing/funds/mutual funds
505	CLINTON	Well, he owes you the answers to that, and he should provide them.	/education/teaching and classroom resources;/education/homework and study tips;/law, govt and politics;/family and parenting/children;/education/studying business;/business and industrial/business operations/management/business process;/technology and computing/internet technology/web search/people search;/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/finance/financial news;/business and industrial/business software
506	HOLT	He also -- he also raised the issue of your e-mails.	/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/society/unrest and war;/finance/financial news;/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/law, govt and politics/law enforcement;/law, govt and politics/politics

508	CLINTON	I do.	
509	CLINTON	You know, I made a mistake using a private e- mail.	/technology and computing/internet technology/email

511	CLINTON	And if I had to do it over again, I would, obviously, do it differently.	/law, govt and politics;/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/law, govt and politics/politics;/family and parenting/children;/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/education/homework and study tips;/education/teaching and classroom resources;/society/sex

520	TRUMP	When you have your staff taking the Fifth Amendment, taking the Fifth so they're not prosecuted, when you have the man that set up the illegal server taking the Fifth, I think it's disgraceful.	/technology and computing/hardware/computer/servers

713	CLINTON	We cannot just say law and order.	/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/law enforcement;/society/unrest and war
714	CLINTON	We have to say -- we have to come forward with a plan that is going to divert people from the criminal justice system, deal with mandatory minimum sentences, which have put too many people away for too long for doing too little.	/society/crime;/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/law enforcement

864	CLINTON	And clearly, as Donald just admitted, he knew he was going to stand on this debate stage, and Lester Holt was going to be asking us questions, so he tried to put the whole racist birther lie to bed.	/society/racism;/law, govt and politics
865	CLINTON	But it can't be dismissed that easily.	/sports/cricket;/sports/bowling
866	CLINTON	He has really started his political activity based on this racist lie that our first black president was not an American citizen.	/society/racism
867	CLINTON	There was absolutely no evidence for it, but he persisted, he persisted year after year, because some of his supporters, people that he was trying to bring into his fold, apparently believed it or wanted to believe it.	/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/politics;/religion and spirituality/islam;/science/weather;/society/senior living;/religion and spirituality/christianity;/society/crime/personal offense/homicide

962	TRUMP	ISIS.	
963	TRUMP	So we have to get very, very tough on cyber and cyber warfare.	/technology and computing/computer crime

977	CLINTON	It does involve going after them online.	/technology and computing/internet technology;/technology and computing/internet technology/internet cafes;/technology and computing/internet technology/social network
978	CLINTON	I think we need to do much more with our tech companies to prevent ISIS and their operatives from being able to use the Internet to radicalize, even direct people in our country and Europe and elsewhere.	/technology and computing/internet technology;/technology and computing/internet technology/internet cafes;/technology and computing/tech news;/technology and computing/computer reviews
979	CLINTON	But we also have to intensify our air strikes against ISIS and eventually support our Arab and Kurdish partners to be able to actually take out ISIS in Raqqa, end their claim of being a Caliphate.	/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/religion and spirituality/islam

983	CLINTON	But we have to be cognizant of the fact that they've had foreign fighters coming to volunteer for them, foreign money, foreign weapons, so we have to make this the top priority.	/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/business and industrial/war industry/weaponry;/law, govt and politics/armed forces/air force;/business and industrial/business operations;/society/unrest and war;/travel/transports;/finance/financial news

993	TRUMP	We will take out ISIS.	/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/religion and spirituality/islam
994	TRUMP	Well, President Obama and Secretary Clinton created a vacuum the way they got out of Iraq, because they got out -- what, they shouldn't have been in, but once they got in, the way they got out was a disaster.	/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/science;/law, govt and politics/government
995	TRUMP	And ISIS was formed.	/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/religion and spirituality/islam

1000	TRUMP	And then you wouldn't have had them.	/hobbies and interests/home recording;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/family and parenting/babies and toddlers;/family and parenting/parenting teens;/society;/sports/go kart;/society/teens;/home and garden/bed and bath/bedroom/beds and headboards;/health and fitness/addiction;/hobbies and interests/games
1001	TRUMP	Or, as I've been saying for a long time, and I think you'll agree, because I said it to you once, had we taken the oil -- and we should have taken the oil -- ISIS would not have been able to form either, because the oil was their primary source of income.	/business and industrial/energy/oil
1002	TRUMP	And now they have the oil all over the place, including the oil -- a lot of the oil in Libya, which was another one of her disasters.	/business and industrial/energy/oil
1003	HOLT	Secretary Clinton?	/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections

1023	CLINTON	So we've got to do everything we can to vacuum up intelligence from Europe, from the Middle East.	/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/armed forces
1024	CLINTON	That means we've got to work more closely with our allies, and that's something that Donald has been very dismissive of.	/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics

1137	CLINTON	You know, NATO as a military alliance has something called Article 5, and basically it says this: An attack on one is an attack on all.	/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/law, govt and politics/armed forces/army

1140	CLINTON	With respect to Iran, when I became secretary of state, Iran was weeks away from having enough nuclear material to form a bomb.	/business and industrial/energy/nuclear power;/law, govt and politics/government/heads of state;/business and industrial/energy/nuclear power/nuclear accident
1141	CLINTON	They had mastered the nuclear fuel cycle under the Bush administration.	/business and industrial/energy/nuclear power;/business and industrial/energy/nuclear power/nuclear accident

1145	CLINTON	I voted for every sanction against Iran when I was in the Senate, but it wasn't enough.	/law, govt and politics/government

1148	CLINTON	And my successor, John Kerry, and President Obama got a deal that put a lid on Iran's nuclear program without firing a single shot.	/law, govt and politics/government/heads of state;/law, govt and politics/armed forces
1149	CLINTON	That's diplomacy.	/law, govt and politics/politics/foreign policy;/society/unrest and war

19	CLINTON	That's why the slogan of my campaign is "Stronger Together," because I think if we work together, if we overcome the divisiveness that sometimes sets Americans against one another, and instead we make some big goals -- and I've set forth some big goals, getting the economy to work for everyone, not just those at the top, making sure that we have the best education system from preschool through college and making it affordable, and so much else.	/family and parenting/children/daycare and preschool;/education

103	CLINTON	Well, like everyone else, I've spent a lot of time thinking over the last 48 hours about what we heard and saw.	/art and entertainment/shows and events;/family and parenting/children;/family and parenting/parenting teens;/family and parenting/babies and toddlers/baby clothes;/society/unrest and war;/society/dating;/law, govt and politics;/style and fashion/body art;/society/teens;/society/senior living
104	CLINTON	You know, with prior Republican nominees for president, I disagreed with them on politics, policies, principles, but I never questioned their fitness to serve.	/law, govt and politics/government;/health and fitness;/law, govt and politics/politics;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections;/society/welfare/healthcare;/law, govt and politics/politics/political parties;/society/unrest and war
105	CLINTON	Donald Trump is different.	/technology and computing/internet technology/social network;/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/immigration;/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/real estate
106	CLINTON	I said starting back in June that he was not fit to be president and commander-in-chief.	/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/government;/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/government/heads of state;/law, govt and politics/government/parliament;/law, govt and politics/armed forces/army;/law, govt and politics/government/executive branch;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement

108	CLINTON	What we all saw and heard on Friday was Donald talking about women, what he thinks about women, what he does to women.	/health and fitness/women's health;/society/sex;/society/social institution/divorce;/family and parenting/motherhood;/health and fitness/sexuality;/family and parenting/motherhood/pregnancy;/family and parenting/children

116	CLINTON	So, yes, this is who Donald Trump is.	/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections
117	CLINTON	But it's not only women, and it's not only this video that raises questions about his fitness to be our president, because he has also targeted immigrants, African- Americans, Latinos, people with disabilities, POWs, Muslims, and so many others.	/religion and spirituality/islam;/law, govt and politics/immigration;/health and fitness

198	TRUMP	Go back and take a look at those commercials, a race where you lost fair and square, unlike the Bernie Sanders race, where you won, but not fair and square, in my opinion.	/careers/job fairs
199	TRUMP	And all you have to do is take a look at WikiLeaks and just see what they say about Bernie Sanders and see what Deborah Wasserman Schultz had in mind, because Bernie Sanders, between super-delegates and Deborah Wasserman Schultz, he never had a chance.	/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections;/law, govt and politics/armed forces/veterans

328	COOPER	Secretary Clinton?	/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections
329	CLINTON	Well, I think Donald was about to say he's going to solve it by repealing it and getting rid of the Affordable Care Act.	/health and fitness/drugs;/law, govt and politics/government;/health and fitness/men's health;/health and fitness/dental care
330	CLINTON	And I'm going to fix it, because I agree with you.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/society;/family and parenting;/business and industrial/business software;/automotive and vehicles/buying and selling cars;/family and parenting/babies and toddlers;/hobbies and interests/getting published;/society/unrest and war;/hobbies and interests/games

332	CLINTON	Copays, deductibles, prescription drug costs, and I've laid out a series of actions that we can take to try to get those costs down.	/health and fitness/drugs
333	CLINTON	But here's what I don't want people to forget when we're talking about reining in the costs, which has to be the highest priority of the next president, when the Affordable Care Act passed, it wasn't just that 20 million got insurance who didn't have it before.	/health and fitness/drugs;/law, govt and politics/government;/health and fitness/men's health;/health and fitness/dental care;/family and parenting/eldercare
334	CLINTON	But that in and of itself was a good thing.	/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/health and fitness/sexuality;/society/sex;/society/teens;/family and parenting/parenting teens;/society/sex/pornography;/style and fashion/body art;/law, govt and politics/immigration;/family and parenting/babies and toddlers;/real estate/buying and selling homes
335	CLINTON	I meet these people all the time, and they tell me what a difference having that insurance meant to them and their families.	/family and parenting;/family and parenting/children;/finance/financial news
336	CLINTON	But everybody else, the 170 million of us who get health insurance through our employees got big benefits.	/society/welfare/healthcare
337	CLINTON	Number one, insurance companies can't deny you coverage because of a pre-existing condition.	/health and fitness/drugs;/news/national news;/business and industrial/business news;/sports/sports news;/health and fitness/men's health;/law, govt and politics;/health and fitness/dental care;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/art and entertainment/shows and events/sports event;/family and parenting/eldercare

339	CLINTON	Number three, women can't be charged more than men for our health insurance, which is the way it used to be before the Affordable Care Act.	/health and fitness/drugs;/health and fitness/men's health;/law, govt and politics/government;/health and fitness/women's health;/health and fitness/dental care;/family and parenting/eldercare;/education/special education;/society/sex
340	CLINTON	Number four, if you're under 26, and your parents have a policy, you can be on that policy until the age of 26, something that didn't happen before.	/family and parenting/children;/law, govt and politics
341	CLINTON	So I want very much to save what works and is good about the Affordable Care Act.	/health and fitness/drugs;/law, govt and politics/government;/health and fitness/men's health;/health and fitness/dental care;/family and parenting/eldercare
342	CLINTON	But we've got to get costs down.	/business and industrial/energy/electricity;/business and industrial/energy/renewable energy;/business and industrial/green solutions;/health and fitness/drugs;/finance/investing/funds;/business and industrial/energy/nuclear power;/finance/investing/beginning investing;/finance/financial news;/automotive and vehicles/electric vehicles;/business and industrial/energy/nuclear power/nuclear accident

344	CLINTON	But if we repeal it, as Donald has proposed, and start over again, all of those benefits I just mentioned are lost to everybody, not just people who get their health insurance on the exchange.	/society/welfare/healthcare
345	CLINTON	And then we would have to start all over again.	/sports/boat racing;/sports/baseball;/automotive and vehicles/auto parts;/society/unrest and war;/automotive and vehicles/cars/car culture;/business and industrial/construction;/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/automotive and vehicles/buying and selling cars;/sports/go kart

381	COOPER	Your husband called Obamacare, quote, "the craziest thing in the world," saying that small-business owners are getting killed as premiums double, coverage is cut in half.	/health and fitness/drugs;/real estate/buying and selling homes;/health and fitness/dental care;/law, govt and politics/government;/news/national news;/business and industrial/business news

388	CLINTON	And the Affordable Care Act was meant to try to fill the gap between people who were too poor and couldn't put together any resources to afford health care, namely people on Medicaid.	/society/welfare/healthcare
389	CLINTON	Obviously, Medicare, which is a single-payer system, which takes care of our elderly and does a great job doing it, by the way, and then all of the people who were employed, but people who were working but didn't have the money to afford insurance and didn't have anybody, an employer or anybody else, to help them.	/health and fitness/drugs;/family and parenting/eldercare

457	CLINTON	And I've heard this question from a lot of Muslim-Americans across our country, because, unfortunately, there's been a lot of very divisive, dark things said about Muslims.	/religion and spirituality/islam
458	CLINTON	And even someone like Captain Khan, the young man who sacrificed himself defending our country in the United States Army, has been subject to attack by Donald.	/law, govt and politics/armed forces/army

467	CLINTON	We need American Muslims to be part of our eyes and ears on our front lines.	/religion and spirituality/islam
468	CLINTON	I've worked with a lot of different Muslim groups around America.	/religion and spirituality/islam
469	CLINTON	I've met with a lot of them, and I've heard how important it is for them to feel that they are wanted and included and part of our country, part of our homeland security, and that's what I want to see.	/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/law enforcement;/law, govt and politics/immigration;/society/unrest and war

639	TRUMP	One of the greatest provisions for people like me, to be honest with you, I give up a lot when I run, because I knock out the tax code.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/legislative;/real estate/buying and selling homes;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/society/work;/family and parenting/children;/society/work/retirement
640	TRUMP	And she could have done this years ago, by the way.	/science/geology/volcanology/volcanic eruptions;/society/dating

644	TRUMP	Why didn't you change it when you were a senator?	/law, govt and politics/government
645	TRUMP	The reason you didn't is that all your friends take the same advantage that I do.	/sports/go kart;/hobbies and interests/home recording;/society/dating;/hobbies and interests/games;/hobbies and interests/magic and illusion;/family and parenting/children;/family and parenting/babies and toddlers/baby clothes;/family and parenting/parenting teens;/style and fashion/body art;/society/senior living
646	TRUMP	And I do.

648	TRUMP	But you wouldn't change it, because all of these people gave you the money so you can take negative ads on Donald Trump.	/business and industrial/advertising and marketing/advertising;/finance/financial news
649	TRUMP	But -- and I say that about a lot of things.	/society/social institution/divorce;/law, govt and politics;/society/sex;/family and parenting/children;/health and fitness/incest and abuse support;/news;/family and parenting/parenting teens;/society/social institution/marriage;/health and fitness/sexuality;/art and entertainment/shows and events

665	TRUMP	And what that's going to do is a disaster for the country.	/science;/science/weather;/law, govt and politics;/science/weather/meteorological disaster

679	COOPER	Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes.	/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections

683	CLINTON	And it is sort of amusing to hear somebody who hasn't paid federal income taxes in maybe 20 years talking about what he's going to do.	/society/work/unemployment;/law, govt and politics/government;/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/real estate/buying and selling homes;/law, govt and politics/government/executive branch;/society/work/retirement;/health and fitness/drugs;/business and industrial/business news;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/society/dating

689	CLINTON	I have said nobody who makes less than $250,000 a year -- and that's the vast majority of Americans as you know -- will have their taxes raised, because I think we've got to go where the money is.	/law, govt and politics;/real estate/buying and selling homes;/society/work/unemployment;/finance/financial news;/finance/investing/funds;/society/unrest and war;/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/law, govt and politics/immigration;/finance/investing/beginning investing;/law, govt and politics/government

692	CLINTON	I voted to close, I think, one of the loopholes he took advantage of when he claimed a billion-dollar loss that enabled him to avoid paying taxes.	/business and industrial/company/earnings;/law, govt and politics/government;/real estate/buying and selling homes;/finance/financial news;/society/work/unemployment;/finance/investing/funds;/finance/investing/beginning investing;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/finance/bank;/business and industrial/business operations

694	CLINTON	It's called the Buffett rule.	/finance/investing;/finance/investing/beginning investing;/finance/investing/portfolio

1142	CLINTON	This is one of the most important issues in this election.	/law, govt and politics/politics/elections;/law, govt and politics/politics/political parties;/law, govt and politics/government
1143	CLINTON	I want to appoint Supreme Court justices who understand the way the world really works, who have real-life experience, who have not just been in a big law firm and maybe clerked for a judge and then gotten on the bench, but, you know, maybe they tried some more cases, they actually understand what people are up against.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary;/law, govt and politics/legal issues/legislation/family laws;/law, govt and politics/legal issues/civil rights/privacy

1147	CLINTON	I would like the Supreme Court to understand that voting rights are still a big problem in many parts of our country, that we don't always do everything we can to make it possible for people of color and older people and young people to be able to exercise their franchise.	/health and fitness/exercise
1148	CLINTON	I want a Supreme Court that will stick with Roe v.

1153	CLINTON	I want a Supreme Court that understands because you're wealthy and you can give more money to something doesn't mean you have any more rights or should have any more rights than anybody else.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary;/society/social institution/divorce;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/law, govt and politics/government/legislative;/family and parenting;/society/social institution/marriage/common law marriage;/society/gay life

1155	CLINTON	And I regret deeply that the Senate has not done its job and they have not permitted a vote on the person that President Obama, a highly qualified person, they've not given him a vote to be able to be have the full complement of nine Supreme Court justices.	/law, govt and politics/government;/education/special education

1165	TRUMP	I'm looking for judges -- and I've actually picked 20 of them so that people would see, highly respected, highly thought of, and actually very beautifully reviewed by just about everybody.	/law, govt and politics/government/courts and judiciary;/art and entertainment/shows and events;/art and entertainment/shows and events/concert

1169	TRUMP	They'll respect the Second Amendment and what it stands for, what it represents.	/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/legislative

1235	CLINTON	First of all, China is illegally dumping steel in the United States and Donald Trump is buying it to build his buildings, putting steelworkers and American steel plants out of business.	/business and industrial/iron and steel industry;/society/work
1236	CLINTON	That's something that I fought against as a senator and that I would have a trade prosecutor to make sure that we don't get taken advantage of by China on steel or anything else.	/law, govt and politics/government;/business and industrial/iron and steel industry;/society/unrest and war;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections;/society/crime/personal offense

1239	CLINTON	But the Middle East still controls a lot of the prices.	/real estate/buying and selling homes;/society/work/unemployment;/finance/financial news;/finance/investing/day trading;/finance/investing/beginning investing;/business and industrial/war industry;/finance/investing/stocks
1240	CLINTON	So the price of oil has been way down.	/business and industrial/energy/oil/oil and gas prices

17	QUIJANO	Twenty-eight years ago tomorrow night, Lloyd Bentsen said the vice presidential debate was not about the qualifications for the vice presidency, but about how if tragedy should occur, the vice president has to step in without any margin for error, without time for preparation, to take over the responsibility for the biggest job in the world.	/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections;/law, govt and politics/government

32	KAINE	It'll be whether we can make somebody's life better, whether we can make a classroom better learning environment for schoolkids or teachers, whether we can make a safer -- it's going to be about results.	/education/teaching and classroom resources
33	KAINE	And she said to me, you've been a missionary and a civil rights lawyer.	/society/gay life;/society/racism;/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/government;/religion and spirituality/christianity

203	KAINE	Hillary and I have a plan that's on the table that's a "you're hired" plan.	/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/business and industrial/construction
204	KAINE	Five components.	/technology and computing/hardware/computer components
205	KAINE	First thing we do is we invest in manufacturing, infrastructure, and research in the clean energy jobs of tomorrow.	/business and industrial/manufacturing
206	KAINE	Second thing is we invest in our workforce, from pre-K education to great teachers to debt-free college and tuition-free college for families that make less than $125,000 a year.	/education;/education/studying business;/education/special education;/finance/grants, scholarships and financial aid;/education/school;/education/teaching and classroom resources
207	KAINE	Third, we promote fairness by raising the minimum wage, so you can't work full-time and be under the poverty level, and by paying women equal pay for equal work.	/education/special education;/education/high school;/society/work/unemployment;/law, govt and politics/government
208	KAINE	Fourth, we promote small business growth, just as we've done in Virginia, to make it easier to start and grow small businesses.	/finance/investing;/finance/investing/beginning investing;/business and industrial;/finance/financial news;/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/finance/investing/venture capital;/law, govt and politics/government;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/society/work/unemployment;/business and industrial/business software
209	KAINE	Hillary and I each grew up in small-business families.	/family and parenting;/family and parenting/children
210	KAINE	My dad, who ran an iron working and welding shop, is here tonight.	/business and industrial/metals;/business and industrial/business operations/management/business process;/business and industrial/iron and steel industry;/business and industrial/manufacturing
211	KAINE	And, fifth, we have a tax plan that targets tax relief to middle- class individuals and small businesses and asks those at the very top who've benefited as we've come out of recession to pay more.	/education/special education
212	KAINE	The Trump plan is a different plan.	/business and industrial/construction;/law, govt and politics;/law, govt and politics/government;/real estate;/law, govt and politics/immigration;/society/work/retirement;/finance/investing/funds;/law, govt and politics/armed forces;/law, govt and politics/government/executive branch;/health and fitness/drugs
213	KAINE	It's a "you're fired" plan.	/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/travel/transports/sea travel;/business and industrial/construction;/society/work/retirement;/society/unrest and war
214	KAINE	And there's two key elements to it.	/business and industrial/business operations;/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/business and industrial/war industry/weaponry;/society/unrest and war;/business and industrial/business operations/management/business process;/business and industrial/logistics;/society/dating;/style and fashion/body art;/law, govt and politics/politics;/sports/fencing
215	KAINE	First, Donald Trump said wages are too high.	/society/work;/society/work/unemployment;/society/welfare/healthcare
216	KAINE	And both Donald Trump and Mike Pence think we ought to eliminate the federal minimum wage.	/society/welfare/healthcare
217	KAINE	Mike Pence, when he was in Congress, voted against raising the minimum wage above $5.15.	/law, govt and politics/government;/society/work/unemployment;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections;/law, govt and politics/government/executive branch;/society/work/unions
218	KAINE	And he has been a one-man bulwark against minimum wage increases in Indiana.	/society/work/unemployment;/society/welfare/healthcare;/law, govt and politics/government;/society/work/unions;/law, govt and politics/government/state and local government
219	KAINE	The second component of the plan is massive tax breaks for the very top, trillions of dollars of tax breaks for people just like Donald Trump.	/finance/bank;/finance/investing/funds;/society/work/unemployment;/finance/investing/beginning investing;/finance/financial news;/law, govt and politics/government;/finance/grants, scholarships and financial aid/government grants;/real estate/buying and selling homes;/business and industrial/construction;/real estate/low income housing
220	KAINE	The problem with this, Elaine, is that's exactly what we did 10 years ago and it put the economy into the deepest recession -- the deepest recession since the 1930s.	/society/work/unemployment;/finance/bank
221	KAINE	Independent analysts say the Clinton plan would grow the economy by 10.5 million jobs.	/society/work/unemployment;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections

223	KAINE	And Donald Trump -- why would he do this?	/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections
224	KAINE	Because his tax plan basically helps him.	/business and industrial/company/earnings;/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/finance/investing/funds;/real estate/buying and selling homes
225	KAINE	And if he ever met his promise and he gave his tax returns to the American public like he said he would, we would see just how much his economic plan is really a Trump-first plan.	/business and industrial/business operations/business plans;/law, govt and politics/politics;/society/work/unemployment;/society/unrest and war;/careers/career planning;/finance/investing;/finance/investing/beginning investing;/law, govt and politics/government/government contracting and procurement;/finance/investing/funds;/finance/financial news

1178	KAINE	We just did an extensive sanctions package against North Korea.	/automotive and vehicles/cars/coupe;/automotive and vehicles/cars/convertible;/automotive and vehicles/cars/sedan

1206	KAINE	I try to practice my religion in a very devout way and follow the teachings of my church in my own personal life.	/religion and spirituality
1207	KAINE	But I don't believe in this nation, a First Amendment nation, where we don't raise any religion over the other, and we allow people to worship as they please, that the doctrines of any one religion should be mandated for everyone.	/religion and spirituality
1208	KAINE	For me, the hardest struggle in my faith life was the Catholic Church is against the death penalty and so am I.	/religion and spirituality/christianity/catholicism;/religion and spirituality/christianity/protestantism
1209	KAINE	But I was governor of a state, and the state law said that there was a death penalty for crimes if the jury determined them to be heinous.	/society/crime;/society/crime/personal offense/homicide;/law, govt and politics/government

1230	PENCE	But for me, I would tell you that for me the sanctity of life proceeds out of the belief that -- that ancient principle that -- where God says before you were formed in the womb, I knew you, and so for my first time in public life, I sought to stand with great compassion for the sanctity of life.	/religion and spirituality;/religion and spirituality/christianity;/religion and spirituality/hinduism;/society/social institution/divorce

1233	PENCE	I think if you're going to be pro-life, you should -- you should be pro- adoption.	/family and parenting/adoption;/family and parenting/children
1234	PENCE	But what I can't understand is with Hillary Clinton and now Senator Kaine at her side is to support a practice like partial-birth abortion.	/law, govt and politics/government
1235	PENCE	I mean, to hold to the view -- and I know Senator Kaine, you hold pro-life views personally -- but the very idea that a child that is almost born into the world could still have their life taken from them is just anathema to me.	/law, govt and politics/government;/family and parenting/children;/law, govt and politics/politics/elections/presidential elections

1246	KAINE	So let's talk about abortion and choice.	/family and parenting/motherhood/pregnancy;/society/sex/sex education
1247	KAINE	Let's talk about them.	/art and entertainment/celebrity fan and gossip

1252	KAINE	Governor Pence wants to repeal Roe v. Wade.	/law, govt and politics/government;/society/sex/sex education;/health and fitness/incest and abuse support;/health and fitness/women's health;/health and fitness/drugs

1256	KAINE	Before Roe v. Wade, states could pass criminal laws to do just that, to punish women if they made the choice to terminate a pregnancy.	/family and parenting/motherhood/pregnancy
